              "'\\nIndians are the citizens and nationals of the Republic of India. According to the 2011 Indian national census, the population of India stood at over 1.2 billion people, making it the world\\'s second-most populous country that contains 17.50 percent of the global population. In India, the term \"Indian\" refers to nationality, rather than a particular ethnicity or language; the Indian nationality consists of dozens of regional ethnolinguistic groups, reflecting the population\\'s rich and complex history. The Indian diaspora is significantly large and present throughout the world, notably in other parts of Asia as well as in North America, Europe, the Caribbean, Oceania, and Africa.[4] The demonym Indian applies to nationals of the present-day Republic of India; however, before the partition of India in 1947, the demonym applied to all people residing in the entirety of British India, which included what is now Pakistan and Bangladesh.[25][26]\\nIn Canada, the Caribbean, and the United States, the terms Asian Indian and East Indian are sometimes used to avoid confusion with Canadian First Nations, the indigenous peoples of the Caribbean, and Native Americans, who are also commonly known as \"Indian\" since the European colonial era.\\nThe name Bhārata has been used as a self-ascribed name by people of the Indian subcontinent and the Republic of India since 1949.[27] The designation \"Bhārata\" appears in the official Sanskrit name of the country, Bhārata Gaṇarājya. The name is derived from the ancient Vedic and Puranas, which refer to the land that comprises India as \"Bhārata varṣam\" and uses this term to distinguish it from other varṣas or continents.[28] The Bhāratas were a vedic tribe mentioned in the Rigveda, notably participating in the Battle of the Ten Kings.[29] India is named after legendary Emperor Bharata who was a descendant of the Bhāratas tribe, scion of Kuru Dynasty who unified the Indian Subcontinent under one realm.[30]\\nIn early Vedic literature, the term Āryāvarta (Sanskrit: आर्यावर्त) was in popular use before Bhārata. The Manusmṛti (2.22) gives the name Āryāvarta to \"the tract between the Himalaya and the Vindhya ranges, from the Eastern (Bay of Bengal) to the Western Sea (Arabian Sea)\".[33][34]\\nWhile the word Indian and India is derived from Greek Ἰνδία (Indía), via Latin India. Indía in Koine Greek denoted the region beyond the Indus (Ἰνδός) river, since Herodotus (5th century BC) ἡ Ἰνδική χώρη, hē Indikē chōrē; \"the Indian land\", Ἰνδός, Indos, \"an Indian\", from Old Persian Hinduš and medieval term Hindustani.[35] The name is derived ultimately from Sindhu, the Sanskrit name of the river Indus, but also meaning \"river\" generically.[36]\\nThe history of India includes the prehistoric settlements and societies in the Indian subcontinent; the blending of the Indus Valley civilization and Indo-Aryan culture into the Vedic Civilization; the development of Hinduism as a synthesis of various Indian cultures and traditions; the rise of sixteen oligarchic republics known as Mahajanapadas; the rise of the Śramaṇa movement; the birth of Jainism and Buddhism in the 6th century\\xa0BCE,[37] and the onset of a succession of powerful dynasties and empires for more than two millennia throughout various geographic areas of the subcontinent, including the growth of Muslim dynasties during the Medieval period intertwined with Hindu powers; the advent of European traders resulting in the establishment of British India; and the subsequent independence movement that led to the Partition of India and the creation of the Republic of India.\\nThe Indian people established during the ancient and medieval periods to the early eighteenth century some of the greatest empires and dynasties in South Asian history like the Maurya Empire, Satavahana dynasty, Gupta Empire, Rashtrakuta dynasty, Chalukya Empire, Chola Empire, Karkota Empire, Pala Empire, Vijayanagara Empire, Delhi Sultanate, Mughal Empire, Maratha Empire and Sikh Empire. The first great empire of the Indian people was the Maurya Empire having Patliputra(currently Patna, Bihar) as its capital, conquered the major part of South Asia in the 4th and 3rd centuries BC during the reign of the Indian Emperors Chandragupta Maurya and Ashoka alongside their senior advisor, Acharya Chanakya, the world\\'s pioneer of the fields of political science and economics. The next great ancient empire of the Indian people was the Gupta Empire. This period, witnessing a Hindu religious and intellectual resurgence, is known as the classical or \"Golden Age of India\". During this period, aspects of Indian civilisation, administration, culture, and Hinduism and Buddhism spread to much of Asia, while the Chola Empire in the south had flourishing maritime trade links with the Roman Empire during this period. The ancient Indian mathematicians Aryabhata, Bhāskara I and Brahmagupta invented the concept of zero and the Hindu–Arabic numeral system decimal system during this period.[38] During this period Indian cultural influence spread over many parts of Southeast Asia which led to the establishment of Indianized kingdoms in Southeast Asia.[39]\\nDuring the early medieval period the great Rashtrakuta dynasty governed most of the Indian subcontinent from the 8th to 10th centuries and the Indian Emperor Amoghavarsha of the Rashtrakuta Dynasty was described by the Arab traveller Sulaiman as one of the four great kings of the world.[40] The medieval south Indian mathematician Mahāvīra lived in the Rashtrakuta dynasty and was the first Indian mathematician who separated astrology from mathematics and who wrote the earliest Indian text entirely devoted to mathematics.[41] The greatest maritime empire of the medieval Indians was the Chola dynasty. Under the great Indian Emperors Rajaraja Chola I and his successor Rajendra Chola I the Chola dynasty became a military, economic and cultural power in South Asia and South-East Asia.[42][43] The power of the Chola empire was proclaimed to the eastern world by the expedition to the Ganges which Rajendra Chola I undertook and by the occupation of cities of the maritime empire of Srivijaya in Southeast Asia, as well as by the repeated embassies to China.[44]\\nDuring the late medieval period the great Vijayanagara Empire ruled most of southern India from the 14th to 16th centuries and reached its peak during the reign of the south Indian Emperor Sri Krishnadevaraya[45] The medieval Kerala School of Astronomy and Mathematics flourished during this period under such well known south Indian mathematicians as Madhava (c. 1340–1425), who made important contributions to Trigonometry and Calculus, and Nilakhanta (c. 1444–1545), who postulated on the orbitals of planets.[46]\\nThe Mughal Empire consolidated much of the Indian sub-continent under a single realm. Under the Mughals, India developed a strong and stable economy, leading to commercial expansion and greater patronage of culture, greatly influencing Indian society.[47] The Mughal Empire balanced and pacified local societies through new administrative practices[48][49] and had diverse and inclusive ruling elites,[50] leading to more systematic, centralised, and uniform rule.[51] Newly coherent social groups in northern and western India, such as the Marathas, the Rajputs, the Pathans, the Jats and the Sikhs, gained military and governing ambitions during Mughal rule, which, through collaboration or adversity, gave them both recognition and military experience.[52][53][54][55]\\nThe Marathas and Sikhs emerged in the 17th century and established the Maratha Empire and Sikh Empire, which became the dominant powers in India in the 18th century.[56] The Maratha Empire is credited to a large extent for ending the Mughal rule in India.[57][58][59][60] The empire at its peak stretched from Tamil Nadu in the south, to Peshawar, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa in the north[61] and Bengal and the Andaman Islands in the east.[62]\\nThe decline of Mughal Empire and Maratha Empire from the late 18th century to the mid-19th century lead to large areas of India being annexed by the British East India Company of the British Empire and witnessed a period of rapid development of infrastructure, economic decline and major famines.[63][64] During the first half of the 20th century, a nationwide struggle for Indian independence movement was launched, the Indian subcontinent gained independence from the United Kingdom in 1947, after the British provinces were partitioned into the dominions of India and Pakistan and the princely states all acceded to one of the new states.[65][66][67]\\nIndia is one of the world\\'s oldest civilisations.[68] The Indian culture, often labelled as an amalgamation of several various cultures, spans across the Indian subcontinent and has been influenced and shaped by a history that is several thousand years old.[69][70] Throughout the history of India, Indian culture has been heavily influenced by Dharmic religions.[71] They have been credited with shaping much of Indian philosophy, literature, architecture, art and music.[72] Greater India was the historical extent of Indian culture beyond the Indian subcontinent. This particularly concerns the spread of Hinduism, Buddhism, architecture, administration and writing system from India to other parts of Asia through the Silk Road by the travellers and maritime traders during the early centuries of the Common Era.[73][74] To the west, Greater India overlaps with Greater Persia in the Hindu Kush and Pamir Mountains.[75] During medieval period, Islam played a significant role in shaping Indian cultural heritage.[76] Over the centuries, there has been significant integration of Hindus, Jains, and Sikhs with Muslims across India.[77][78]\\nIndia is the birthplace of Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism and Sikhism, collectively known as Indian religions.[71] Indian religions, also known as Dharmic religions, are a major form of world religions along with Abrahamic ones. Today, Hinduism and Buddhism are the world\\'s third- and fourth-largest religions respectively, with over 1 billion followers altogether,[79][80][81] and possibly as many as 1.5 or 1.6 billion followers.[79][82] Throughout India\\'s history, religion has been an important part of the country\\'s culture. Religious diversity and religious tolerance are both established in the country by the law and by custom; the Constitution of India has declared the right to freedom of religion to be a fundamental right.[83]\\nAtheism and agnosticism have a long history in India and flourished within Śramaṇa movement.[84] The Cārvāka school originated in India around the 6th century\\xa0BCE and is one of the earliest form of materialistic and atheistic movement in ancient India.[85][86][87] Sramana, Buddhism, Jainism, Ājīvika and some schools of Hinduism like Samkhya consider atheism to be valid and reject the concept of creator deity, ritualism and supernaturalism.[88][89][90] India has produced some notable atheist politicians and social reformers.[91][92]\\nAlthough approximately 80% of the citizens of India are Hindus, the country has a substantial population of Muslims, Christians, Sikhs, Buddhists, Jains, Parsis and adherents of tribal faiths.[93] Zoroastrianism and Judaism each has several thousands of Indian adherents, and also have an ancient history in India.[94] India has the largest population of people adhering to Zoroastrianism and Baháʼí Faith in the world, even though these two religions are not native to India.[95] Many other world religions also have a relationship with Indian spirituality, such as the Baháʼí Faith which recognises Buddha and Krishna as manifestations of the God Almighty.[96] Despite the strong role of religion in Indian life, atheism and agnostics also have visible influence along with a self-ascribed tolerance to other people. According to the 2012 WIN-Gallup Global Index of Religion and Atheism report, 81% of Indians were religious, 13% were not religious, 3% were convinced atheists, and 3% were unsure or did not respond.[97]\\nTraditionally, Indian society is grouped according to their caste. It is a system in which social stratification within various social sections defined by thousands of endogamous hereditary groups are often termed jāti or castes. Within a jāti, there exists exogamous groups known as gotras, the lineage or clan of an individuals.[98] Caste barriers have mostly broken down in cities but still exists in some form in rural areas.[99]\\nMost Indian states are majority Hindu. However, Kashmir and Lakshadweep are majority Muslim; Nagaland, Mizoram, and Meghalaya are majority Christian and Punjab is majority Sikh. Although participants in the Indian census may choose to not declare their religion, there is no mechanism for a person to indicate that he/she does not adhere to any religion. Due to this limitation in the Indian census process, the data for persons not affiliated with any religion may not be accurate. India contains the majority of the world\\'s Hindus, Jains, Sikhs, Zoroastrians and Baháʼí. Christianity is widespread in Northeast India, parts of southern India, particularly in Kerala and among various populations of Central India. Muslims are the largest religious minority. India is also home to the third-largest Muslim population in the world after Indonesia and Pakistan.[100][101][102]\\nHistorically, India had a prevailing tradition of the joint family system or undivided family. Joint family system is an extended family arrangement prevalent throughout the Indian subcontinent, particularly in India.[103] The family is headed by a patriarch, the oldest male, who makes decisions on economic and social matters on behalf of the entire family. The patriarch\\'s wife generally exerts control over the household, minor religious practices and often wields considerable influence in domestic matters. A patrilineal joint family consists of an older man and his wife, his sons and unmarried daughters, his sons’ wives and children. Family income flows into a common pool, from which resources are drawn to meet the needs of all members, which are regulated by the heads of the family.[104] However, with modernisation and economic development, India has witnessed a break up of traditional joint family into more nuclear families and the traditional joint family in India accounted for a small percent of Indian households.[105][106]\\nArranged marriages have been the tradition in Indian society. Marriage is considered a union of the two families rather than just the individuals, the process involved in an arranged marriage can be different depending on the communities and families. Recent survey study found that fewer marriages are purely arranged without consent and that the majority of surveyed Indian marriages are arranged with consent.[107] The study also suggested that Indian culture is trending away from traditional arranged marriages, they find that the marriage trends in India are similar to trends observed over last 40 years where arranged marriages were previously common, particularly in China and Japan.[107]\\nIndia\\'s clothing styles have continuously evolved over the course of history. Cotton was first cultivated in Indian subcontinent around the 5th millennium BC.[108] Dyes used during this period are still in use, particularly indigo, red madder, lac and turmeric.[109] Silk was woven around 2450 BC and 2000 BC.[110][111] In the 11th century BC Rig-veda mentions dyed and embroidered garments known as paridhan and pesas respectively and thus highlights the development of sophisticated garment manufacturing techniques during this period.[112] In the 5th century\\xa0BCE, Greek historian Herodotus describes the richness of the quality of Indian textiles.[113] By the 2nd century\\xa0AD, cotton, muslins and silk textiles manufactured in India were imported by the Roman Empire and was one of the major exports of ancient India to other parts of the world along with Indian spices and Wootz steel.[114]\\nTraditional Indian clothing greatly varies across different parts of the country and is influenced by local culture, geography and climate. Women traditionally wear Sari, Gagra Choli, Angarkha, Phiran, Shalwar Kameez, Gharara and Bandi with Dupatta or Ghoonghat worn over head or shoulder to complete the outfit.[115] Men traditionally wear Angarkha, Achkan, Kurta, Kameez, Phiran, Sherwani and Koti for upper garment, lower garment includes Dhoti, Churidar, Shalwar, and Lungi. Pagri is usually worn around head to complete the outfit.[116] In urban centres, people often wear western clothing and variety of other contemporary fashion.[117]\\nIndian food varies from region to region. Staple foods of Indian cuisine include a variety of lentils (dal), whole-wheat flour (aṭṭa), rice and pearl millet (bājra), which has been cultivated in Indian subcontinent since 6200\\xa0BCE.[118][119] Over time, segments of the population embraced vegetarianism during Śramaṇa movement[120][121] while an equitable climate permitted a variety of fruits, vegetables, and grains to be grown throughout the year. A food classification system that categorised any item as saatvic, raajsic or taamsic developed in Yoga tradition.[122][123] The Bhagavad Gita prescribed certain dietary practices. During this period, consumption of various types of meat became taboo, due to being considered sacred or impure.[124][125] Indian cuisines use numerous ingredients, deploy a wide range of food preparation styles, cooking techniques and culinary presentation depending on geographical location.[126]\\nThe oldest preserved examples of Indian music are the melodies of the Samaveda (1000 BC) that are still sung in certain Śrauta sacrifices; this is the earliest account of Indian musical hymns.[127] The Samaveda, and other Hindu texts, heavily influenced India\\'s classical music tradition, which is known today in two distinct styles: Hindustani music and Carnatic music. Both the Hindustani and Carnatic music systems are based on the melodic base known as Rāga, sung to a rhythmic cycle known as Tāla. These principles were refined in the nātyaśāstra (200\\xa0BC) and the dattilam (300\\xa0AD).[128]\\nThe nātyaśāstrais an ancient Indian treatise on the performing arts, encompassing theatre, dance and music. It was written during the period between 200\\xa0BCE and 200\\xa0CE in classical India and is traditionally attributed to the Sage Bharata.[129] Natya Shastra is incredibly wide in its scope. While it primarily deals with stagecraft, it has come to influence music, classical dance, and literature as well. It covers stage design, music, dance, makeup, and virtually every other aspect of stagecraft.\\nIndian drama and theatre has a long history alongside its music and dance. One of the earliest known theatre play is Mṛcchakatika composed by Śudraka. Followed by Aśvaghoṣa\\'s Śāriputraprakaraṇa and Bhāsa\\'s Swapnavāsavadatta and Pancharātra. Most notable works are Kālidāsa\\'s Abhijñānaśākuntala, Vikramorvaśīya and Mālavikāgnimitra. Harsha\\'s Ratnavali, Priyadarsika, and Naganandam, other notable ancient dramatists include Bhatta Narayana, Bhavabhuti, Vishakhadatta, Thirayattam[130] and Viswanatha Kaviraja.[131]\\nNotable fable story-plays Panchatantra, Baital Pachisi, Kathasaritsagara, Brihatkatha and Jataka tales were performed in folk theatres since ancient period.[132] Jataka tales has become part of Southeast and East Asian folklore with the spread of Buddhism. These literature\\'s were also influential in development of One Thousand and One Nights during medieval period.[133]\\nIndian people have played a major role in the development of the philosophy, sciences, mathematics, arts, architecture and astronomy throughout history. During the ancient period, notable mathematics accomplishment of India included Hindu–Arabic numeral system with decimal place-value and a symbol for zero, interpolation formula, Fibonacci\\'s identity, theorem, the first complete arithmetic solution (including zero and negative solutions) to quadratic equations.[134] Chakravala method, sign convention, madhava series, and the sine and cosine in trigonometric functions can be traced to the jyā and koti-jyā.[135] Notable military inventions include war elephants, crucible steel weapons popularly known as Damascus steel and Mysorean rockets.[136] Other notable inventions during ancient period include chess, cotton, sugar, fired bricks, carbon pigment ink, ruler, lac, lacquer, stepwell, indigo dye, snake and ladder, muslin, ludo, calico, Wootz steel, incense clock, shampoo, palampore, chintz, and prefabricated homes.\\nIndian cultural aspects, religions, philosophy, arts and architecture have developed over several millennia and have spread through much of Asia in peaceful manner.[74] Many architectural structures of India such as Sanchi Stupa, Taj Mahal and Mahabodhi Temple are UNESCO World Heritage sites today.[137]\\nIn modern times, Indian people have continued to contribute to mathematics, sciences and astrophysics. Among them are Satyendra Nath Bose, Srinivasa Ramanujan, Jagadish Chandra Bose, Meghnad Saha, Homi J. Bhabha, Prasanta Chandra Mahalanobis, and notable Nobel Prize recipients C. V. Raman, Har Gobind Khorana, Venkatraman Ramakrishnan, and Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar who is notable for currently accepted theory on the later evolutionary stages of massive stars, including black holes.[138]\\nBharat Mata (Hindi, from Sanskrit भारत माता, Bhārata Mātā), Mother India, or Bhāratāmbā (from अंबा ambā \\'mother\\') is the national personification of India as a mother goddess.\\nThe image of Bharat Mata formed with the Indian independence movement of the late 19th century. A play by Kiran Chandra Bandyopadhyay, Bhārat Mātā, was first performed in 1873. She is usually depicted as a woman clad in an orange or saffron sari holding a flag and sometimes accompanied by a lion.[139]\\nSports in India are mainly in two categories traditional sports and global sports. Traditional sports like gilli danda, kho kho, kabaddi are quite popular. On the other hand, Indians are highly enthusiastic about the game of cricket that it is treated as a religion in itself.[140] Sports like hockey, volleyball, football are quite popular while polo, golf and tennis are preferred sports for affluent sections of the society. The traditional game of chess is now a world sport where global players compete in major tournaments. In recent times with government support Olympic sports like shooting, archery, wrestling, javelin throw, swimming, badminton have gained prominence in the Indian society.[141]\\nAlthough, population groups originating in different parts of the Indian subcontinent and within the international borders of the modern country of India had been migrating to Southeast Asia, East Asia, Central Asia, North Africa, and even along Europe\\'s Mediterranean coast, the Indian diaspora generally socio-politically or historically refers to those whose families or themselves migrated to other parts of the world after the British Empire established itself in India. Population estimates vary from a conservative 12 million to 20 million-person diaspora.[148][149]\\nThe British Indian community had grown to number over one million. According to the 2001 UK Census, 1,053,411 Britons had full Indian ancestry (representing 1.8% of the UK\\'s population). An overwhelming majority of 99.3% resided in England (in 2008 the figure is thought to be around 97.0%). In the seven-year period between 2001 and 2009, the number of Indian-born people in the UK increased in size by 38% from 467,634 to around 647,000 (an increase of approximately 180,000).[150]\\nThere are over 1.3 million people of Indian origin or ancestry in Canada, the majority of which live in Greater Toronto and Vancouver, with growing communities in Alberta and Quebec. Nearly 4% of the total Canadian population is of Indian ancestry, a figure higher than both the United States and Britain. According to Statistics Canada, Indo-Canadians are one of the fastest-growing visible minority groups in Canada, making up the second-largest group of non-European descent in the country after Chinese Canadians. The Indo-Canadian community can trace its history in Canada back 120 years to 1897 when a contingent of Sikh soldiers visited the western coast of Canada, primarily British Columbia which at the time was very sparsely populated and the Canadian government wanted to settle in order to prevent a takeover of the territory by the United States.\\nMore than a million people of South Asian descent live in South Africa, with their ancestors having left colonial India mostly as indentured labourers, and with smaller numbers emigrating later as \"Passenger Indians\", in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. They are concentrated around the city of Durban. They were classified as members of an \"Indian\" race under the country\\'s defunct Apartheid system.[151]\\nAbout 40,000 people of Indian origin live in Tanzania mostly in the urban areas.\\nAccording to the American Community Survey of the United States Census Bureau, the Indian American population in the United States grew from almost 1.67 million in 2000 to 3.1 million in 2010 which is the third-largest Asian American community in the United States after Chinese Americans and Filipino Americans.\\nAfter slavery was abolished in the European colonies, Indians were hired to become indentured labourers to fill the need for cheap labor. Indians primarily from the Awadh and Bhojpur regions of the Hindi Belt in the present-day states of Bihar, Jharkhand, and Uttar Pradesh in North India and the Terai region in Nepal, along with a significant minority who came from South India, and a much extremely smaller minority who came from Bengal, Punjab, Braj, Bundelkhand, Bagelkhand, Mithila, Malwa, Jammu, Kashmir, Rohilkhand, Chhattisgarh, Odisha, Haryana, Maharashtra, Kutch, Marwar, Mewar, and Gujarat were sent to the Caribbean by the British, Dutch, and French from the late 1830s to the early 1920s as indentured laborers to work on the sugarcane, cocoa, rice, banana, and coffee estates. After the first wave of migration of indentured laborers, more Indians from Gujarat, Sindh, Kutch, Punjab, Bengal, and South India came to the Caribbean for business from the 1930s to present-day. There are more than a million Indo-Caribbeans. Most of them live in Trinidad and Tobago, Guyana, Suriname, and Jamaica. There are few in other Caribbean countries such as Martinique, Guadeloupe, French Guiana, Belize, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Saint Lucia, Barbados, Grenada, Saint Kitts and Nevis, and the British Virgin Islands. The Indians from Bhojpuri and Awadhi-speaking areas of the Hindi Belt were the majority of Indians in Trinidad and Tobago, Guyana, Suriname, and Jamaica, hence their dialect of Hindustani became known as Caribbean Hindustani and it became the lingua franca of the Indian immigrants. Since the Bhojpuri and Awadhi-speaking Indians formed the largest group of Indians, the traditions and culture from the Bhojpur, Purvaanchal, and Awadh regions became the dominant culture for the Indians in those countries. France sent southern Indians to its colonies in the Caribbean as indentured laborers, hence there are also many residents of Indian descent in Guadeloupe, Martinique, and French Guiana, mostly of southern Indian descent. Many Indo-Caribbeans have migrated to the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, the Netherlands, and France, and few of them have even seasonally migrated to the neighboring Latin American and other Caribbean countries as migrant workers. A majority of Indo-Caribbean are Hindus, while there is significant minority of Muslims and Christians, along with smaller numbers of Jains, Sikhs, Buddhist, Baháʼís, or adherents of another faith. Indo-Caribbeans are known as the descendants of the jahajis or girmityas.[152][153][154][155][156]\\nRecent genome studies appear to show that South Asians are a mixture of two major ancestral components, one component restricted to South Asia and the other component shared with Central Asia, West Asia, and Europe.[157][158]\\nMr Thakur said CJI Ramana\\'s remarks raised questions on the credibility of the media. (file)Information and Broadcasting Minister Anurag Thakur on Saturday called for introspection by media houses of their functioning after Chief Justice of India NV Ramana said kangaroo courts by media were detrimental to the health of democracy.Speaking at the National Broadcasting Day function at All India Radio here, Mr Thakur said CJI Ramana\\'s remarks raised questions on the credibility of the media.\"We need to introspect whether we have crossed the \\'Lakshman Rekha\\' while delivering news,\" Mr Thakur said.\"I wish to urge friends in the media that if such an impression is being created, there is a need for introspection,\" he said.Agenda-driven debates and kangaroo courts being run by the media are detrimental to the health of the democracy, CJI Ramana said in Ranchi.The CJI said media trials affect the fair functioning and independence of the judiciary. Addressing the gathering, Mr Thakur said that some people surmised that radio was going to have an existential crisis with the advent of television and subsequently the internet. However, radio has identified its audience and not just maintained its relevance but also its credibility, he said.\"When people want to listen to unbiased news, they naturally tune in to All India Radio and Doordarshan news. That 92 per cent of the country\\'s geography and over 99 per cent of people are covered by All India Radio is a commendable achievement,\" he said.The minister underlined the importance of content and said that it was content that drew people to the channel and no amount of reach through towers can match the importance of content. He expressed hope that in the digital age, radio would strengthen its presence among the people.The minister also released promos of new serials on Doordarshan - Corporate Sarpanch: Beti Desh Ki, Jai Bharati, Suron ka Eklavya, and Ye Dil Mange More.Minister of State for Information and Broadcasting L Murugan highlighted the important role played by radio during the freedom struggle when many freedom fighters employed it as a tool for communication against the British imperial government.(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)Track Latest News Live on NDTV.com and get news updates from India  and around the world.

Advertisement ................................\\nIndia, officially the Republic of India (Hindi: Bhārat Gaṇarājya),[26] is a country in South Asia. It is the seventh-largest country by area, the second-most populous country, and the most populous democracy in the world. Bounded by the Indian Ocean on the south, the Arabian Sea on the southwest, and the Bay of Bengal on the southeast, it shares land borders with Pakistan to the west;[f] China, Nepal, and Bhutan to the north; and Bangladesh and Myanmar to the east. In the Indian Ocean, India is in the vicinity of Sri Lanka and the Maldives; its Andaman and Nicobar Islands share a maritime border with Thailand, Myanmar and Indonesia.\\nModern humans arrived on the Indian subcontinent from Africa no later than 55,000 years ago.[27][28][29]\\nTheir long occupation, initially in varying forms of isolation as hunter-gatherers, has made the region highly diverse, second only to Africa in human genetic diversity.[30] Settled life emerged on the subcontinent in the western margins of the Indus river basin 9,000 years ago, evolving gradually into the Indus Valley civilisation of the third millennium BCE.[31]\\nBy 1200\\xa0BCE, an archaic form of Sanskrit, an Indo-European language, had diffused into India from the northwest,[32][33] unfolding as the language of the Rigveda, and recording the dawning of Hinduism in India.[34] The Dravidian languages of India were supplanted in the northern and western regions.[35]\\nBy 400\\xa0BCE, stratification and exclusion by caste had emerged within Hinduism,[36]\\nand Buddhism and Jainism had arisen, proclaiming social orders unlinked to heredity.[37]\\nEarly political consolidations gave rise to the loose-knit Maurya and Gupta Empires based in the Ganges Basin.[38]\\nTheir collective era was suffused with wide-ranging creativity,[39] but also marked by the declining status of women,[40] and the incorporation of untouchability into an organised system of belief.[g][41] In South India, the Middle kingdoms exported Dravidian-languages scripts and religious cultures to the kingdoms of Southeast Asia.[42]\\nIn the early medieval era, Christianity, Islam, Judaism, and Zoroastrianism became established on India\\'s southern and western coasts.[43]\\nMuslim armies from Central Asia intermittently overran India\\'s northern plains,[44]\\neventually founding the Delhi Sultanate, and drawing northern India into the cosmopolitan networks of medieval Islam.[45]\\nIn the 15th century, the Vijayanagara Empire created a long-lasting composite Hindu culture in south India.[46]\\nIn the Punjab, Sikhism emerged, rejecting institutionalised religion.[47]\\nThe Mughal Empire, in 1526, ushered in two centuries of relative peace,[48]\\nleaving a legacy of luminous architecture.[h][49]\\nGradually expanding rule of the British East India Company followed, turning India into a colonial economy, but also consolidating its sovereignty.[50] British Crown rule began in 1858. The rights promised to Indians were granted slowly,[51][52] but technological changes were introduced, and ideas of education, modernity and the public life took root.[53] A pioneering and influential nationalist movement emerged, which was noted for nonviolent resistance and became the major factor in ending British rule.[54][55] In 1947 the British Indian Empire was partitioned into two independent dominions,[56][57][58][59] a Hindu-majority Dominion of India and a Muslim-majority Dominion of Pakistan, amid large-scale loss of life and an unprecedented migration.[60]\\nIndia has been a federal republic since 1950, governed in a democratic parliamentary system. It is a pluralistic, multilingual and multi-ethnic society. India\\'s population grew from 361 million in 1951 to 1.211\\xa0billion in 2011.[61]\\nDuring the same time, its nominal per capita income increased from US$64 annually to US$1,498, and its literacy rate from 16.6% to 74%. From being a comparatively destitute country in 1951,[62]\\nIndia has become a fast-growing major economy and a hub for information technology services, with an expanding middle class.[63] It has a space programme which includes several planned or completed extraterrestrial missions. Indian movies, music, and spiritual teachings play an increasing role in global culture.[64]\\nIndia has substantially reduced its rate of poverty, though at the cost of increasing economic inequality.[65]\\nIndia is a nuclear-weapon state, which ranks high in military expenditure. It has disputes over Kashmir with its neighbours, Pakistan and China, unresolved since the mid-20th century.[66]\\nAmong the socio-economic challenges India faces are gender inequality, child malnutrition,[67]\\nand rising levels of air pollution.[68]\\nIndia\\'s land is megadiverse, with four biodiversity hotspots.[69] Its forest cover comprises 21.7% of its area.[70] India\\'s wildlife, which has traditionally been viewed with tolerance in India\\'s culture,[71] is supported among these forests, and elsewhere, in protected habitats.\\nAccording to the Oxford English Dictionary (third edition 2009), the name \"India\" is derived from the Classical Latin India, a reference to South Asia and an uncertain region to its east; and in turn derived successively from: Hellenistic Greek India ( Ἰνδία); ancient Greek Indos ( Ἰνδός); Old Persian Hindush, an eastern province of the Achaemenid empire; and ultimately its cognate, the Sanskrit Sindhu, or \"river,\" specifically the Indus River and, by implication, its well-settled southern basin.[72][73] The ancient Greeks referred to the Indians as Indoi (Ἰνδοί), which translates as \"The people of the Indus\".[74]\\nThe term Bharat (Bhārat; pronounced\\xa0[ˈbʱaːɾət] (listen)), mentioned in both Indian epic poetry and the Constitution of India,[75][76] is used in its variations by many Indian languages. A modern rendering of the historical name Bharatavarsha, which applied originally to North India,[77][78] Bharat gained increased currency from the mid-19th century as a native name for India.[75][79]\\nHindustan ([ɦɪndʊˈstaːn] (listen)) is a Middle Persian name for India, introduced during the Mughal Empire and used widely since. Its meaning has varied, referring to a region encompassing present-day northern India and Pakistan or to India in its near entirety.[75][79][80]\\nBy 55,000 years ago, the first modern humans, or Homo sapiens, had arrived on the Indian subcontinent from Africa, where they had earlier evolved.[27][28][29] The earliest known modern human remains in South Asia date to about 30,000 years ago.[27] After 6500\\xa0BCE, evidence for domestication of food crops and animals, construction of permanent structures, and storage of agricultural surplus appeared in Mehrgarh and other sites in what is now Balochistan, Pakistan.[82] These gradually developed into the Indus Valley civilisation,[83][82] the first urban culture in South Asia,[84] which flourished during 2500–1900\\xa0BCE in what is now Pakistan and western India.[85] Centred around cities such as Mohenjo-daro, Harappa, Dholavira, and Kalibangan, and relying on varied forms of subsistence, the civilisation engaged robustly in crafts production and wide-ranging trade.[84]\\nDuring the period 2000–500\\xa0BCE, many regions of the subcontinent transitioned from the Chalcolithic cultures to the Iron Age ones.[86] The Vedas, the oldest scriptures associated with Hinduism,[87] were composed during this period,[88] and historians have analysed these to posit a Vedic culture in the Punjab region and the upper Gangetic Plain.[86] Most historians also consider this period to have encompassed several waves of Indo-Aryan migration into the subcontinent from the north-west.[87] The caste system, which created a hierarchy of priests, warriors, and free peasants, but which excluded indigenous peoples by labelling their occupations impure, arose during this period.[89] On the Deccan Plateau, archaeological evidence from this period suggests the existence of a chiefdom stage of political organisation.[86] In South India, a progression to sedentary life is indicated by the large number of megalithic monuments dating from this period,[90] as well as by nearby traces of agriculture, irrigation tanks, and craft traditions.[90]\\nIn the late Vedic period, around the 6th century BCE, the small states and chiefdoms of the Ganges Plain and the north-western regions had consolidated into 16 major oligarchies and monarchies that were known as the mahajanapadas.[91][92] The emerging urbanisation gave rise to non-Vedic religious movements, two of which became independent religions. Jainism came into prominence during the life of its exemplar, Mahavira.[93] Buddhism, based on the teachings of Gautama Buddha, attracted followers from all social classes excepting the middle class; chronicling the life of the Buddha was central to the beginnings of recorded history in India.[94][95][96] In an age of increasing urban wealth, both religions held up renunciation as an ideal,[97] and both established long-lasting monastic traditions. Politically, by the 3rd century BCE, the kingdom of Magadha had annexed or reduced other states to emerge as the Mauryan Empire.[98] The empire was once thought to have controlled most of the subcontinent except the far south, but its core regions are now thought to have been separated by large autonomous areas.[99][100] The Mauryan kings are known as much for their empire-building and determined management of public life as for Ashoka\\'s renunciation of militarism and far-flung advocacy of the Buddhist dhamma.[101][102]\\nThe Sangam literature of the Tamil language reveals that, between 200\\xa0BCE and 200\\xa0CE, the southern peninsula was ruled by the Cheras, the Cholas, and the Pandyas, dynasties that traded extensively with the Roman Empire and with West and South-East Asia.[103][104] In North India, Hinduism asserted patriarchal control within the family, leading to increased subordination of women.[105][98] By the 4th and 5th centuries, the Gupta Empire had created a complex system of administration and taxation in the greater Ganges Plain; this system became a model for later Indian kingdoms.[106][107] Under the Guptas, a renewed Hinduism based on devotion, rather than the management of ritual, began to assert itself.[108] This renewal was reflected in a flowering of sculpture and architecture, which found patrons among an urban elite.[107] Classical Sanskrit literature flowered as well, and Indian science, astronomy, medicine, and mathematics made significant advances.[107]\\nThe Indian early medieval age, from 600 to 1200\\xa0CE, is defined by regional kingdoms and cultural diversity.[109] When Harsha of Kannauj, who ruled much of the Indo-Gangetic Plain from 606 to 647\\xa0CE, attempted to expand southwards, he was defeated by the Chalukya ruler of the Deccan.[110] When his successor attempted to expand eastwards, he was defeated by the Pala king of Bengal.[110] When the Chalukyas attempted to expand southwards, they were defeated by the Pallavas from farther south, who in turn were opposed by the Pandyas and the Cholas from still farther south.[110] No ruler of this period was able to create an empire and consistently control lands much beyond their core region.[109] During this time, pastoral peoples, whose land had been cleared to make way for the growing agricultural economy, were accommodated within caste society, as were new non-traditional ruling classes.[111] The caste system consequently began to show regional differences.[111]\\nIn the 6th and 7th centuries, the first devotional hymns were created in the Tamil language.[112] They were imitated all over India and led to both the resurgence of Hinduism and the development of all modern languages of the subcontinent.[112] Indian royalty, big and small, and the temples they patronised drew citizens in great numbers to the capital cities, which became economic hubs as well.[113] Temple towns of various sizes began to appear everywhere as India underwent another urbanisation.[113] By the 8th and 9th centuries, the effects were felt in South-East Asia, as South Indian culture and political systems were exported to lands that became part of modern-day Myanmar, Thailand, Laos, Brunei, Cambodia, Vietnam, Philippines, Malaysia, and Indonesia.[114] Indian merchants, scholars, and sometimes armies were involved in this transmission; South-East Asians took the initiative as well, with many sojourning in Indian seminaries and translating Buddhist and Hindu texts into their languages.[114]\\nAfter the 10th century, Muslim Central Asian nomadic clans, using swift-horse cavalry and raising vast armies united by ethnicity and religion, repeatedly overran South Asia\\'s north-western plains, leading eventually to the establishment of the Islamic Delhi Sultanate in 1206.[115] The sultanate was to control much of North India and to make many forays into South India. Although at first disruptive for the Indian elites, the sultanate largely left its vast non-Muslim subject population to its own laws and customs.[116][117] By repeatedly repulsing Mongol raiders in the 13th century, the sultanate saved India from the devastation visited on West and Central Asia, setting the scene for centuries of migration of fleeing soldiers, learned men, mystics, traders, artists, and artisans from that region into the subcontinent, thereby creating a syncretic Indo-Islamic culture in the north.[118][119] The sultanate\\'s raiding and weakening of the regional kingdoms of South India paved the way for the indigenous Vijayanagara Empire.[120] Embracing a strong Shaivite tradition and building upon the military technology of the sultanate, the empire came to control much of peninsular India,[121] and was to influence South Indian society for long afterwards.[120]\\nIn the early 16th century, northern India, then under mainly Muslim rulers,[122] fell again to the superior mobility and firepower of a new generation of Central Asian warriors.[123] The resulting Mughal Empire did not stamp out the local societies it came to rule. Instead, it balanced and pacified them through new administrative practices[124][125] and diverse and inclusive ruling elites,[126] leading to more systematic, centralised, and uniform rule.[127] Eschewing tribal bonds and Islamic identity, especially under Akbar, the Mughals united their far-flung realms through loyalty, expressed through a Persianised culture, to an emperor who had near-divine status.[126] The Mughal state\\'s economic policies, deriving most revenues from agriculture[128] and mandating that taxes be paid in the well-regulated silver currency,[129] caused peasants and artisans to enter larger markets.[127] The relative peace maintained by the empire during much of the 17th century was a factor in India\\'s economic expansion,[127] resulting in greater patronage of painting, literary forms, textiles, and architecture.[130] Newly coherent social groups in northern and western India, such as the Marathas, the Rajputs, and the Sikhs, gained military and governing ambitions during Mughal rule, which, through collaboration or adversity, gave them both recognition and military experience.[131] Expanding commerce during Mughal rule gave rise to new Indian commercial and political elites along the coasts of southern and eastern India.[131] As the empire disintegrated, many among these elites were able to seek and control their own affairs.[132]\\nBy the early 18th century, with the lines between commercial and political dominance being increasingly blurred, a number of European trading companies, including the English East India Company, had established coastal outposts.[133][134] The East India Company\\'s control of the seas, greater resources, and more advanced military training and technology led it to increasingly assert its military strength and caused it to become attractive to a portion of the Indian elite; these factors were crucial in allowing the company to gain control over the Bengal region by 1765 and sideline the other European companies.[135][133][136][137] Its further access to the riches of Bengal and the subsequent increased strength and size of its army enabled it to annexe or subdue most of India by the 1820s.[138] India was then no longer exporting manufactured goods as it long had, but was instead supplying the British Empire with raw materials. Many historians consider this to be the onset of India\\'s colonial period.[133] By this time, with its economic power severely curtailed by the British parliament and having effectively been made an arm of British administration, the company began more consciously to enter non-economic arenas, including education, social reform and culture.[139]\\nHistorians consider India\\'s modern age to have begun sometime between 1848 and 1885. The appointment in 1848 of Lord Dalhousie as Governor General of the East India Company set the stage for changes essential to a modern state. These included the consolidation and demarcation of sovereignty, the surveillance of the population, and the education of citizens. Technological changes—among them, railways, canals, and the telegraph—were introduced not long after their introduction in Europe.[140][141][142][143] However, disaffection with the company also grew during this time and set off the Indian Rebellion of 1857. Fed by diverse resentments and perceptions, including invasive British-style social reforms, harsh land taxes, and summary treatment of some rich landowners and princes, the rebellion rocked many regions of northern and central India and shook the foundations of Company rule.[144][145] Although the rebellion was suppressed by 1858, it led to the dissolution of the East India Company and the direct administration of India by the British government. Proclaiming a unitary state and a gradual but limited British-style parliamentary system, the new rulers also protected princes and landed gentry as a feudal safeguard against future unrest.[146][147] In the decades following, public life gradually emerged all over India, leading eventually to the founding of the Indian National Congress in 1885.[148][149][150][151]\\nThe rush of technology and the commercialisation of agriculture in the second half of the 19th century was marked by economic setbacks and many small farmers became dependent on the whims of far-away markets.[152] There was an increase in the number of large-scale famines,[153] and, despite the risks of infrastructure development borne by Indian taxpayers, little industrial employment was generated for Indians.[154] There were also salutary effects: commercial cropping, especially in the newly canalled Punjab, led to increased food production for internal consumption.[155] The railway network provided critical famine relief,[156] notably reduced the cost of moving goods,[156] and helped nascent Indian-owned industry.[155]\\nAfter World War I, in which approximately one million Indians served,[157] a new period began. It was marked by British reforms but also repressive legislation, by more strident Indian calls for self-rule, and by the beginnings of a nonviolent movement of non-co-operation, of which Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi would become the leader and enduring symbol.[158] During the 1930s, slow legislative reform was enacted by the British; the Indian National Congress won victories in the resulting elections.[159] The next decade was beset with crises: Indian participation in World War\\xa0II, the Congress\\'s final push for non-co-operation, and an upsurge of Muslim nationalism. All were capped by the advent of independence in 1947, but tempered by the partition of India into two states: India and Pakistan.[160]\\nVital to India\\'s self-image as an independent nation was its constitution, completed in 1950, which put in place a secular and democratic republic.[161] It has remained a democracy with civil liberties, an active supreme court, and a largely independent press.[dubious  – discuss][162] Economic liberalisation, which began in the 1990s, has created a large urban middle class, transformed India into one of the world\\'s fastest-growing economies,[163] and increased its geopolitical clout. Indian movies, music, and spiritual teachings play an increasing role in global culture.[162] Yet, India is also shaped by seemingly unyielding poverty, both rural and urban;[162] by religious and caste-related violence;[164] by Maoist-inspired Naxalite insurgencies;[165] and by separatism in Jammu and Kashmir and in Northeast India.[166] It has unresolved territorial disputes with China[167] and with Pakistan.[167] India\\'s sustained democratic freedoms are unique among the world\\'s newer nations; however, in spite of its recent economic successes, freedom from want for its disadvantaged population remains a goal yet to be achieved.[168]\\nIndia accounts for the bulk of the Indian subcontinent, lying atop the Indian tectonic plate, a part of the Indo-Australian Plate.[169] India\\'s defining geological processes began 75 million years ago when the Indian Plate, then part of the southern supercontinent Gondwana, began a north-eastward drift caused by seafloor spreading to its south-west, and later, south and south-east.[169] Simultaneously, the vast Tethyan oceanic crust, to its northeast, began to subduct under the Eurasian Plate.[169] These dual processes, driven by convection in the Earth\\'s mantle, both created the Indian Ocean and caused the Indian continental crust eventually to under-thrust Eurasia and to uplift the Himalayas.[169] Immediately south of the emerging Himalayas, plate movement created a vast crescent-shaped trough that rapidly filled with river-borne sediment[170] and now constitutes the Indo-Gangetic Plain.[171]   The original Indian plate makes its first appearance above the sediment in the ancient Aravalli range, which extends from the Delhi Ridge in a southwesterly direction. To the west lies the Thar desert, the eastern spread of which is checked by the Aravallis.[172][173][174]\\nThe remaining Indian Plate survives as peninsular India, the oldest and geologically most stable part of India. It extends as far north as the Satpura and Vindhya ranges in central India. These parallel chains run from the Arabian Sea coast in Gujarat in the west to the coal-rich Chota Nagpur Plateau in Jharkhand in the east.[176] To the south, the remaining peninsular landmass, the Deccan Plateau, is flanked on the west and east by coastal ranges known as the Western and Eastern Ghats;[177] the plateau contains the country\\'s oldest rock formations, some over one billion years old. Constituted in such fashion, India lies to the north of the equator between 6° 44′ and 35° 30′ north latitude[i] and 68° 7′ and 97° 25′ east longitude.[178]\\nIndia\\'s coastline measures 7,517 kilometres (4,700\\xa0mi) in length; of this distance, 5,423 kilometres (3,400\\xa0mi) belong to peninsular India and 2,094 kilometres (1,300\\xa0mi) to the Andaman, Nicobar, and Lakshadweep island chains.[179] According to the Indian naval hydrographic charts, the mainland coastline consists of the following: 43% sandy beaches; 11% rocky shores, including cliffs; and 46% mudflats or marshy shores.[179]\\nMajor Himalayan-origin rivers that substantially flow through India include the Ganges and the Brahmaputra, both of which drain into the Bay of Bengal.[180] Important tributaries of the Ganges include the Yamuna and the Kosi; the latter\\'s extremely low gradient, caused by long-term silt deposition, leads to severe floods and course changes.[181][182] Major peninsular rivers, whose steeper gradients prevent their waters from flooding, include the Godavari, the Mahanadi, the Kaveri, and the Krishna, which also drain into the Bay of Bengal;[183] and the Narmada and the Tapti, which drain into the Arabian Sea.[184] Coastal features include the marshy Rann of Kutch of western India and the alluvial Sundarbans delta of eastern India; the latter is shared with Bangladesh.[185] India has two archipelagos: the Lakshadweep, coral atolls off India\\'s south-western coast; and the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, a volcanic chain in the Andaman Sea.[186]\\nIndian climate is strongly influenced by the Himalayas and the Thar Desert, both of which drive the economically and culturally pivotal summer and winter monsoons.[187] The Himalayas prevent cold Central Asian katabatic winds from blowing in, keeping the bulk of the Indian subcontinent warmer than most locations at similar latitudes.[188][189] The Thar Desert plays a crucial role in attracting the moisture-laden south-west summer monsoon winds that, between June and October, provide the majority of India\\'s rainfall.[187] Four major climatic groupings predominate in India: tropical wet, tropical dry, subtropical humid, and montane.[190]\\nTemperatures in India have risen by 0.7\\xa0°C (1.3\\xa0°F) between 1901 and 2018.[191] Climate change in India is often thought to be the cause. The retreat of Himalayan glaciers has adversely affected the flow rate of the major Himalayan rivers, including the Ganges and the Brahmaputra.[192] According to some current projections, the number and severity of droughts in India will have markedly increased by the end of the present century.[193]\\nIndia is a megadiverse country, a term employed for 17 countries which display high biological diversity and contain many species exclusively indigenous, or endemic, to them.[196] India is a habitat for 8.6% of all mammal species, 13.7% of bird species, 7.9% of reptile species, 6% of amphibian species, 12.2% of fish species, and 6.0% of all flowering plant species.[197][198] Fully a third of Indian plant species are endemic.[199] India also contains four of the world\\'s 34 biodiversity hotspots,[69] or regions that display significant habitat loss in the presence of high endemism.[k][200]\\nAccording to official statistics, India\\'s forest cover is 713,789\\xa0km2 (275,595\\xa0sq\\xa0mi), which is 21.71% of the country\\'s total land area.[70] It can be subdivided further into broad categories of canopy density, or the proportion of the area of a forest covered by its tree canopy.[201] Very dense forest, whose canopy density is greater than 70%, occupies 3.02% of India\\'s land area.[201][202] It predominates in the tropical moist forest of the Andaman Islands, the Western Ghats, and Northeast India.[195] Moderately dense forest, whose canopy density is between 40% and 70%, occupies 9.39% of India\\'s land area.[201][202] It predominates in the temperate coniferous forest of the Himalayas, the moist deciduous sal forest of eastern India, and the dry deciduous teak forest of central and southern India.[195] Open forest, whose canopy density is between 10% and 40%, occupies 9.26% of India\\'s land area.[201][202] India has two natural zones of thorn forest, one in the Deccan Plateau, immediately east of the Western Ghats, and the other in the western part of the Indo-Gangetic plain, now turned into rich agricultural land by irrigation, its features no longer visible.[203]\\nAmong the Indian subcontinent\\'s notable indigenous trees are the astringent Azadirachta indica, or neem, which is widely used in rural Indian herbal medicine,[204] and the luxuriant Ficus religiosa, or peepul,[205] which is displayed on the ancient seals of Mohenjo-daro,[206] and under which the Buddha is recorded in the Pali canon to have sought enlightenment.[207]\\nMany Indian species have descended from those of Gondwana, the southern supercontinent from which India separated more than 100 million years ago.[208] India\\'s subsequent collision with Eurasia set off a mass exchange of species. However, volcanism and climatic changes later caused the extinction of many endemic Indian forms.[209] Still later, mammals entered India from Asia through two zoogeographical passes flanking the Himalayas.[195] This had the effect of lowering endemism among India\\'s mammals, which stands at 12.6%, contrasting with 45.8% among reptiles and 55.8% among amphibians.[198]} Among endemics are the vulnerable[210] hooded leaf monkey[211] and the threatened[212] Beddome\\'s toad[212][213] of the Western Ghats.\\nIndia contains 172 IUCN-designated threatened animal species, or 2.9% of endangered forms.[214] These include the endangered Bengal tiger and the Ganges river dolphin. Critically endangered species include: the gharial, a crocodilian; the great Indian bustard; and the Indian white-rumped vulture, which has become nearly extinct by having ingested the carrion of diclofenac-treated cattle.[215] Before they were extensively utilized for agriculture and cleared for human settlement, the thorn forests of Punjab were mingled at intervals with open grasslands that were grazed by large herds of blackbuck preyed on by the Asiatic cheetah; the blackbuck, no longer extant in Punjab, is now severely endangered in India, and the cheetah is extinct.[216] The pervasive and ecologically devastating human encroachment of recent decades has critically endangered Indian wildlife. In response, the system of national parks and protected areas, first established in 1935, was expanded substantially. In 1972, India enacted the Wildlife Protection Act[217] and Project Tiger to safeguard crucial wilderness; the Forest Conservation Act was enacted in 1980 and amendments added in 1988.[218] India hosts more than five hundred wildlife sanctuaries and thirteen\\xa0biosphere reserves,[219] four of which are part of the World Network of Biosphere Reserves; twenty-five wetlands are registered under the Ramsar Convention.[220]\\nIndia is the world\\'s most populous democracy.[222] A parliamentary republic with a multi-party system,[223] it has eight\\xa0recognised national parties, including the Indian National Congress and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), and more than 40\\xa0regional parties.[224] The Congress is considered centre-left in Indian political culture,[225] and the BJP right-wing.[226][227][228] For most of the period between 1950—when India first became a republic—and the late 1980s, the Congress held a majority in the parliament. Since then, however, it has increasingly shared the political stage with the BJP,[229] as well as with powerful regional parties which have often forced the creation of multi-party coalition governments at the centre.[230]\\nIn the Republic of India\\'s first three general elections, in 1951, 1957, and 1962, the Jawaharlal Nehru-led Congress won easy victories. On Nehru\\'s death in 1964, Lal Bahadur Shastri briefly became prime minister; he was succeeded, after his own unexpected death in 1966, by Nehru\\'s daughter Indira Gandhi, who went on to lead the Congress to election victories in 1967 and 1971. Following public discontent with the state of emergency she declared in 1975, the Congress was voted out of power in 1977; the then-new Janata Party, which had opposed the emergency, was voted in. Its government lasted just over two years. Voted back into power in 1980, the Congress saw a change in leadership in 1984, when Indira Gandhi was assassinated; she was succeeded by her son Rajiv Gandhi, who won an easy victory in the general elections later that year. The Congress was voted out again in 1989 when a National Front coalition, led by the newly formed Janata Dal in alliance with the Left Front, won the elections; that government too proved relatively short-lived, lasting just under two years.[231] Elections were held again in 1991; no party won an absolute majority. The Congress, as the largest single party, was able to form a minority government led by P. V. Narasimha Rao.[232]\\nA two-year period of political turmoil followed the general election of 1996. Several short-lived alliances shared power at the centre. The BJP formed a government briefly in 1996; it was followed by two comparatively long-lasting United Front coalitions, which depended on external support. In 1998, the BJP was able to form a successful coalition, the National Democratic Alliance (NDA). Led by Atal Bihari Vajpayee, the NDA became the first non-Congress, coalition government to complete a five-year term.[233] Again in the 2004 Indian general elections, no party won an absolute majority, but the Congress emerged as the largest single party, forming another successful coalition: the United Progressive Alliance (UPA). It had the support of left-leaning parties and MPs who opposed the BJP. The UPA returned to power in the 2009 general election with increased numbers, and it no longer required external support from India\\'s communist parties.[234] That year, Manmohan Singh became the first prime minister since Jawaharlal Nehru in 1957 and 1962 to be re-elected to a consecutive five-year term.[235] In the 2014 general election, the BJP became the first political party since 1984 to win a majority and govern without the support of other parties.[236] The incumbent prime minister is Narendra Modi, a former chief minister of Gujarat. On 20 July 2017, Ram Nath Kovind was elected India\\'s 14th president and took the oath of office on 25 July 2017.[237]\\nIndia is a federation with a parliamentary system governed under the Constitution of India—the country\\'s supreme legal document. It is a constitutional republic and representative democracy, in which \"majority rule is tempered by minority rights protected by law\". Federalism in India defines the power distribution between the union and the states. The Constitution of India, which came into effect on 26 January 1950,[239] originally stated India to be a \"sovereign, democratic republic;\" this characterisation was amended in 1971 to \"a sovereign, socialist, secular, democratic republic\".[240] India\\'s form of government, traditionally described as \"quasi-federal\" with a strong centre and weak states,[241] has grown increasingly federal since the late 1990s as a result of political, economic, and social changes.[242][243]\\nThe Government of India comprises three branches:[244]\\nIndia is a federal union comprising 28 states and 8 union territories.[16] All states, as well as the union territories of Jammu and Kashmir, Puducherry and the National Capital Territory of Delhi, have elected legislatures and governments following the Westminster system of governance. The remaining five union territories are directly ruled by the central government through appointed administrators. In 1956, under the States Reorganisation Act, states were reorganised on a linguistic basis.[260] There are over a quarter of a million local government bodies at city, town, block, district and village levels.[261]\\n\\nIn the 1950s, India strongly supported decolonisation in Africa and Asia and played a leading role in the Non-Aligned Movement.[263] After initially cordial relations with neighbouring China, India went to war with China in 1962, and was widely thought to have been humiliated.[264] India has had tense relations with neighbouring Pakistan; the two nations have gone to war four times: in 1947, 1965, 1971, and 1999. Three of these wars were fought over the disputed territory of Kashmir, while the fourth, the 1971 war, followed from India\\'s support for the independence of Bangladesh.[265] In the late 1980s, the Indian military twice intervened abroad at the invitation of the host country: a peace-keeping operation in Sri Lanka between 1987 and 1990; and an armed intervention to prevent a 1988 coup d\\'état attempt in the Maldives. After the 1965 war with Pakistan, India began to pursue close military and economic ties with the Soviet Union; by the late 1960s, the Soviet Union was its largest arms supplier.[266]\\nAside from ongoing its special relationship with Russia,[267] India has wide-ranging defence relations with Israel and France. In recent years, it has played key roles in the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation and the World Trade Organization. The nation has provided 100,000 military and police personnel to serve in 35 UN peacekeeping operations across four continents. It participates in the East Asia Summit, the G8+5, and other multilateral forums.[268] India has close economic ties with countries in South America,[269] Asia, and Africa; it pursues a \"Look East\" policy that seeks to strengthen partnerships with the ASEAN nations, Japan, and South Korea that revolve around many issues, but especially those involving economic investment and regional security.[270][271]\\nChina\\'s nuclear test of 1964, as well as its repeated threats to intervene in support of Pakistan in the 1965 war, convinced India to develop nuclear weapons.[273] India conducted its first nuclear weapons test in 1974 and carried out additional underground testing in 1998. Despite criticism and military sanctions, India has signed neither the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty nor the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, considering both to be flawed and discriminatory.[274] India maintains a \"no first use\" nuclear policy and is developing a nuclear triad capability as a part of its \"Minimum Credible Deterrence\" doctrine.[275][276] It is developing a ballistic missile defence shield and, a fifth-generation fighter jet.[277][278] Other indigenous military projects involve the design and implementation of Vikrant-class aircraft carriers and Arihant-class nuclear submarines.[279]\\nSince the end of the Cold War, India has increased its economic, strategic, and military co-operation with the United States and the European Union.[280] In 2008, a civilian nuclear agreement was signed between India and the United States. Although India possessed nuclear weapons at the time and was not a party to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, it received waivers from the International Atomic Energy Agency and the Nuclear Suppliers Group, ending earlier restrictions on India\\'s nuclear technology and commerce. As a consequence, India became the sixth de facto nuclear weapons state.[281] India subsequently signed co-operation agreements involving civilian nuclear energy with Russia,[282] France,[283] the United Kingdom,[284] and Canada.[285]\\nThe President of India is the supreme commander of the nation\\'s armed forces; with 1.45\\xa0million active troops, they compose the world\\'s second-largest military. It comprises the Indian Army, the Indian Navy, the Indian Air Force, and the Indian Coast Guard.[286] The official Indian defence budget for 2011 was US$36.03\\xa0billion, or 1.83% of GDP.[287] Defence expenditure was pegged at US$70.12\\xa0billion for fiscal year 2022–23 and, increased 9.8% than previous fiscal year.[288][289] India is the world\\'s second largest arms importer; between 2016 and 2020, it accounted for 9.5% of the total global arms imports.[290] Much of the military expenditure was focused on defence against Pakistan and countering growing Chinese influence in the Indian Ocean.[291] In May 2017, the Indian Space Research Organisation launched the South Asia Satellite, a gift from India to its neighbouring SAARC countries.[292] In October 2018, India signed a US$5.43\\xa0billion (over ₹400\\xa0billion) agreement with Russia to procure four S-400 Triumf surface-to-air missile defence systems, Russia\\'s most advanced long-range missile defence system.[293]\\nAccording to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the Indian economy in 2021 was nominally worth $3.04\\xa0trillion; it is the sixth-largest economy by market exchange rates, and is around $10.219\\xa0trillion, the third-largest by purchasing power parity (PPP).[297] With its average annual GDP growth rate of 5.8% over the past two decades, and reaching 6.1% during 2011–2012,[298] India is one of the world\\'s fastest-growing economies.[299] However, the country ranks 139th in the world in nominal GDP per capita and 118th in GDP per capita at PPP.[300] Until 1991, all Indian governments followed protectionist policies that were influenced by socialist economics. Widespread state intervention and regulation largely walled the economy off from the outside world. An acute balance of payments crisis in 1991 forced the nation to liberalise its economy;[301] since then it has moved slowly towards a free-market system[302][303] by emphasising both foreign trade and direct investment inflows.[304] India has been a member of World Trade Organization since 1 January 1995.[305]\\nThe 522-million-worker Indian labour force is the world\\'s second-largest, as of 2017[update].[286] The service sector makes up 55.6% of GDP, the industrial sector 26.3% and the agricultural sector 18.1%. India\\'s foreign exchange remittances of US$87\\xa0billion in 2021, highest in the world, were contributed to its economy by 32 million Indians working in foreign countries.[306] Major agricultural products include: rice, wheat, oilseed, cotton, jute, tea, sugarcane, and potatoes.[16] Major industries include: textiles, telecommunications, chemicals, pharmaceuticals, biotechnology, food processing, steel, transport equipment, cement, mining, petroleum, machinery, and software.[16] In 2006, the share of external trade in India\\'s GDP stood at 24%, up from 6% in 1985.[302] In 2008, India\\'s share of world trade was 1.68%;[307] In 2011, India was the world\\'s tenth-largest importer and the nineteenth-largest exporter.[308] Major exports include: petroleum products, textile goods, jewellery, software, engineering goods, chemicals, and manufactured leather goods.[16] Major imports include: crude oil, machinery, gems, fertiliser, and chemicals.[16] Between 2001 and 2011, the contribution of petrochemical and engineering goods to total exports grew from 14% to 42%.[309] India was the world\\'s second largest textile exporter after China in the 2013 calendar year.[310]\\nAveraging an economic growth rate of 7.5% for several years prior to 2007,[302] India has more than doubled its hourly wage rates during the first decade of the 21st century.[311] Some 431 million Indians have left poverty since 1985; India\\'s middle classes are projected to number around 580\\xa0million by 2030.[312] Though ranking 51st in global competitiveness, as of 2010[update], India ranks 17th in financial market sophistication, 24th in the banking sector, 44th in business sophistication, and 39th in innovation, ahead of several advanced economies.[313] With seven of the world\\'s top 15 information technology outsourcing companies based in India, as of 2009[update], the country is viewed as the second-most favourable outsourcing destination after the United States.[314] India was ranked 46th in the Global Innovation Index in 2021, it has increased its ranking considerably since 2015, where it was 81st.[315][316][317][318] India\\'s consumer market, the world\\'s eleventh-largest, is expected to become fifth-largest by 2030.[312]\\nDriven by growth, India\\'s nominal GDP per capita increased steadily from US$308 in 1991, when economic liberalisation began, to US$1,380 in 2010, to an estimated US$1,730 in 2016. It is expected to grow to US$2,313 by 2022.[21] However, it has remained lower than those of other Asian developing countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Sri Lanka, and Thailand, and is expected to remain so in the near future.\\nAccording to a 2011 PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) report, India\\'s GDP at purchasing power parity could overtake that of the United States by 2045.[320] During the next four decades, Indian GDP is expected to grow at an annualised average of 8%, making it potentially the world\\'s fastest-growing major economy until 2050.[320] The report highlights key growth factors: a young and rapidly growing working-age population; growth in the manufacturing sector because of rising education and engineering skill levels; and sustained growth of the consumer market driven by a rapidly growing middle-class.[320] The World Bank cautions that, for India to achieve its economic potential, it must continue to focus on public sector reform, transport infrastructure, agricultural and rural development, removal of labour regulations, education, energy security, and public health and nutrition.[321]\\nAccording to the Worldwide Cost of Living Report 2017 released by the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU) which was created by comparing more than 400 individual prices across 160 products and services, four of the cheapest cities were in India: Bangalore (3rd), Mumbai (5th), Chennai (5th) and New Delhi (8th).[322]\\nIndia\\'s telecommunication industry is the second-largest in the world with over 1.2 billion subscribers. It contributes 6.5% to India\\'s GDP.[323] After the third quarter of 2017, India surpassed the US to become the second largest smartphone market in the world after China.[324]\\nThe Indian automotive industry, the world\\'s second-fastest growing, increased domestic sales by 26% during 2009–2010,[325] and exports by 36% during 2008–2009.[326] At the end of 2011, the Indian IT industry employed 2.8\\xa0million professionals, generated revenues close to US$100\\xa0billion equalling 7.5% of Indian GDP, and contributed 26% of India\\'s merchandise exports.[327]\\nThe pharmaceutical industry in India emerged as a global player. As of 2021, with 3000 pharmaceutical companies and 10,500 manufacturing units India is the world\\'s third-largest pharmaceutical producer, largest producer of generic medicines and supply up to 50%—60% of global vaccines demand, these all contribute up to US$24.44\\xa0billions in exports and India\\'s local pharmacutical market is estimated up to US$42\\xa0billion.[328][329] India is among the top 12 biotech destinations in the world.[330][331] The Indian biotech industry grew by 15.1% in 2012–2013, increasing its revenues from ₹204.4\\xa0billion (Indian rupees) to ₹235.24\\xa0billion (US$3.94 billion at June 2013 exchange rates).[332]\\nIndia\\'s capacity to generate electrical power is 300 gigawatts, of which 42 gigawatts is renewable.[333] The country\\'s usage of coal is a major cause of greenhouse gas emissions by India but its renewable energy is competing strongly.[334] India emits about 7% of global greenhouse gas emissions. This equates to about 2.5 tons of carbon dioxide per person per year, which is half the world average.[335][336] Increasing access to electricity and clean cooking with liquefied petroleum gas have been priorities for energy in India.[337]\\nDespite economic growth during recent decades, India continues to face socio-economic challenges. In 2006, India contained the largest number of people living below the World Bank\\'s international poverty line of US$1.25 per day.[339] The proportion decreased from 60% in 1981 to 42% in 2005.[340] Under the World Bank\\'s later revised poverty line, it was 21% in 2011.[l][342] 30.7% of India\\'s children under the age of five are underweight.[343] According to a Food and Agriculture Organization report in 2015, 15% of the population is undernourished.[344][345] The Mid-Day Meal Scheme attempts to lower these rates.[346]\\nA 2018 Walk Free Foundation report estimated that nearly 8\\xa0million people in India were living in different forms of modern slavery, such as bonded labour, child labour, human trafficking, and forced begging, among others.[347] According to the 2011 census, there were 10.1\\xa0million child labourers in the country, a decline of 2.6\\xa0million from 12.6\\xa0million in 2001.[348]\\nSince 1991, economic inequality between India\\'s states has consistently grown: the per-capita net state domestic product of the richest states in 2007 was 3.2 times that of the poorest.[349] Corruption in India is perceived to have decreased. According to the Corruption Perceptions Index, India ranked 78th out of 180 countries in 2018 with a score of 41 out of 100, an improvement from 85th in 2014.[350][351]\\nWith 1,210,193,422 residents reported in the 2011 provisional census report,[352] India is the world\\'s second-most populous country. Its population grew by 17.64% from 2001 to 2011,[353] compared to 21.54% growth in the previous decade (1991–2001).[353] The human sex ratio, according to the 2011 census, is 940 females per 1,000 males.[352] The median age was 28.7 as of 2020[update].[286] The first post-colonial census, conducted in 1951, counted 361\\xa0million people.[354] Medical advances made in the last 50 years as well as increased agricultural productivity brought about by the \"Green Revolution\" have caused India\\'s population to grow rapidly.[355]\\nThe average life expectancy in India is at 70 years—71.5 years for women, 68.7 years for men.[286] There are around 93 physicians per 100,000 people.[356] Migration from rural to urban areas has been an important dynamic in India\\'s recent history. The number of people living in urban areas grew by 31.2% between 1991 and 2001.[357] Yet, in 2001, over 70% still lived in rural areas.[358][359] The level of urbanisation increased further from 27.81% in the 2001 Census to 31.16% in the 2011 Census. The slowing down of the overall population growth rate was due to the sharp decline in the growth rate in rural areas since 1991.[360] According to the 2011 census, there are 53 million-plus urban agglomerations in India; among them Mumbai, Delhi, Kolkata, Chennai, Bangalore, Hyderabad and Ahmedabad, in decreasing order by population.[361] The literacy rate in 2011 was 74.04%: 65.46% among females and 82.14% among males.[362] The rural-urban literacy gap, which was 21.2 percentage points in 2001, dropped to 16.1 percentage points in 2011. The improvement in the rural literacy rate is twice that of urban areas.[360] Kerala is the most literate state with 93.91% literacy; while Bihar the least with 63.82%.[362]\\nIndia is home to two major language families: Indo-Aryan (spoken by about 74% of the population) and Dravidian (spoken by 24% of the population). Other languages spoken in India come from the Austroasiatic and Sino-Tibetan language families. India has no national language.[363] Hindi, with the largest number of speakers, is the official language of the government.[364][365] English is used extensively in business and administration and has the status of a \"subsidiary official language\";[6] it is important in education, especially as a medium of higher education. Each state and union territory has one or more official languages, and the constitution recognises in particular 22 \"scheduled languages\".\\nThe 2011 census reported the religion in India with the largest number of followers was Hinduism (79.80% of the population), followed by Islam (14.23%); the remaining were Christianity (2.30%), Sikhism (1.72%), Buddhism (0.70%), Jainism (0.36%) and others[m] (0.9%).[15] India has the third-largest Muslim population—the largest for a non-Muslim majority country.[366][367]\\nIndian cultural history spans more than 4,500 years.[368] During the Vedic period (c.\\u20091700\\xa0BCE\\xa0– c.\\u2009500\\xa0BCE), the foundations of Hindu philosophy, mythology, theology and literature were laid, and many beliefs and practices which still exist today, such as dhárma, kárma, yóga, and mokṣa, were established.[74] India is notable for its religious diversity, with Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, Islam, Christianity, and Jainism among the nation\\'s major religions.[369] The predominant religion, Hinduism, has been shaped by various historical schools of thought, including those of the Upanishads,[370] the Yoga Sutras, the Bhakti movement,[369] and by Buddhist philosophy.[371]\\nIndia has a very ancient tradition of art, which has exchanged many influences with the rest of Eurasia, especially in the first millennium, when Buddhist art spread with Indian religions to Central, East and South-East Asia, the last also greatly influenced by Hindu art.[372]  Thousands of seals from the Indus Valley Civilization of the third millennium BCE have been found, usually carved with animals, but a few with human figures. The \"Pashupati\" seal, excavated in Mohenjo-daro, Pakistan, in 1928–29, is the best known.[373][374]  After this there is a long period with virtually nothing surviving.[374][375] Almost all surviving ancient Indian art thereafter is in various forms of religious sculpture in durable materials, or coins. There was probably originally far more in wood, which is lost. In north India Mauryan art is the first imperial movement.[376][377][378] In the first millennium CE, Buddhist art spread with Indian religions to Central, East and South-East Asia, the last also greatly influenced by Hindu art.[379] Over the following centuries a distinctly Indian style of sculpting the human figure developed, with less interest in articulating precise anatomy than ancient Greek sculpture but showing smoothly-flowing forms expressing prana (\"breath\" or life-force).[380][381] This is often complicated by the need to give figures multiple arms or heads, or represent different genders on the left and right of figures, as with the Ardhanarishvara form of Shiva and Parvati.[382][383]\\nMost of the earliest large sculpture is Buddhist, either excavated from Buddhist stupas such as Sanchi, Sarnath and Amaravati,[384] or is rock-cut reliefs at sites such as Ajanta, Karla and Ellora. Hindu and Jain sites appear rather later.[385][386] In spite of this complex mixture of religious traditions, generally, the prevailing artistic style at any time and place has been shared by the major religious groups, and sculptors probably usually served all communities.[387] Gupta art, at its peak c.\\u2009300\\xa0CE\\xa0– c.\\u2009500\\xa0CE, is often regarded as a classical period whose influence lingered for many centuries after; it saw a new dominance of Hindu sculpture, as at the Elephanta Caves.[388][389] Across the north, this became rather stiff and formulaic after c.\\u2009800\\xa0CE, though rich with finely carved detail in the surrounds of statues.[390] But in the South, under the Pallava and Chola dynasties, sculpture in both stone and bronze had a sustained period of great achievement; the large bronzes with Shiva as Nataraja have become an iconic symbol of India.[391][392]\\nAncient painting has only survived at a few sites, of which the crowded scenes of court life in the Ajanta Caves are by far the most important, but it was evidently highly developed, and is mentioned as a courtly accomplishment in Gupta times.[393][394] Painted manuscripts of religious texts survive from Eastern India about the 10th century onwards, most of the earliest being Buddhist and later Jain. No doubt the style of these was used in larger paintings.[395] The Persian-derived Deccan painting, starting just before the Mughal miniature, between them give the first large body of secular painting, with an emphasis on portraits, and the recording of princely pleasures and wars.[396][397] The style spread to Hindu courts, especially among the Rajputs, and developed a variety of styles, with the smaller courts often the most innovative, with figures such as Nihâl Chand and Nainsukh.[398][399] As a market developed among European residents, it was supplied by Company painting by Indian artists with considerable Western influence.[400][401] In the 19th century, cheap Kalighat paintings of gods and everyday life, done on paper, were urban folk art from Calcutta, which later saw the Bengal School of Art, reflecting the art colleges founded by the British, the first movement in modern Indian painting.[402][403]\\nBhutesvara Yakshis, Buddhist reliefs from Mathura, 2nd century\\xa0CE\\nGupta terracotta relief, Krishna Killing the Horse Demon Keshi, 5th century\\nElephanta Caves, triple-bust (trimurti) of Shiva, 18 feet (5.5\\xa0m) tall, c.\\u2009550\\nChola bronze of Shiva as Nataraja (\"Lord of Dance\"), Tamil Nadu, 10th or 11th century.\\nJahangir Receives Prince Khurram at Ajmer on His Return from the Mewar Campaign, Balchand,  c.\\u20091635\\nKrishna Fluting to the Milkmaids, Kangra painting, 1775–1785\\nMuch of Indian architecture, including the Taj Mahal, other works of Indo-Islamic Mughal architecture,  and South Indian architecture, blends ancient local traditions with imported styles.[404] Vernacular architecture is also regional in its flavours. Vastu shastra, literally \"science of construction\" or \"architecture\" and ascribed to Mamuni Mayan,[405] explores how the laws of nature affect human dwellings;[406] it employs precise geometry and directional alignments to reflect perceived cosmic constructs.[407] As applied in Hindu temple architecture, it is influenced by the Shilpa Shastras, a series of foundational texts whose basic mythological form is the Vastu-Purusha mandala, a square that embodied the \"absolute\".[408] The Taj Mahal, built in Agra between 1631 and 1648 by orders of Mughal emperor Shah Jahan in memory of his wife, has been described in the UNESCO World Heritage List as \"the jewel of Muslim art in India and one of the universally admired masterpieces of the world\\'s heritage\".[409] Indo-Saracenic Revival architecture, developed by the British in the late 19th century, drew on Indo-Islamic architecture.[410]\\nThe earliest literature in India, composed between 1500\\xa0BCE and 1200\\xa0CE, was in the Sanskrit language.[411] Major works of Sanskrit literature include the Rigveda (c.\\u20091500\\xa0BCE\\xa0– c.\\u20091200\\xa0BCE), the epics: Mahābhārata ( c.\\u2009400\\xa0BCE\\xa0– c.\\u2009400\\xa0CE) and the Ramayana ( c.\\u2009300\\xa0BCE and later); Abhijñānaśākuntalam (The Recognition of Śakuntalā, and other dramas of Kālidāsa ( c.\\u20095th century\\xa0CE) and Mahākāvya poetry.[412][413][414] In Tamil literature, the Sangam literature (c.\\u2009600\\xa0BCE\\xa0– c.\\u2009300\\xa0BCE) consisting of 2,381 poems, composed by 473 poets, is the earliest work.[415][416][417][418] From the 14th to the 18th centuries, India\\'s literary traditions went through a period of drastic change because of the emergence of devotional poets like Kabīr, Tulsīdās, and Guru Nānak. This period was characterised by a varied and wide spectrum of thought and expression; as a consequence, medieval Indian literary works differed significantly from classical traditions.[419] In the 19th century, Indian writers took a new interest in social questions and psychological descriptions. In the 20th century, Indian literature was influenced by the works of the Bengali poet, author and philosopher Rabindranath Tagore,[420] who was a recipient of the Nobel Prize in Literature.\\nIndian music ranges over various traditions and regional styles. Classical music encompasses two genres and their various folk offshoots: the northern Hindustani and southern Carnatic schools.[421] Regionalised popular forms include filmi and folk music; the syncretic tradition of the bauls is a well-known form of the latter. Indian dance also features diverse folk and classical forms. Among the better-known folk dances are: the bhangra of Punjab, the bihu of Assam, the Jhumair and chhau of Jharkhand, Odisha and West Bengal, garba and dandiya of Gujarat, ghoomar of Rajasthan, and the lavani of Maharashtra. Eight dance forms, many with narrative forms and mythological elements, have been accorded classical dance status by India\\'s National Academy of Music, Dance, and Drama. These are: bharatanatyam of the state of Tamil Nadu, kathak of Uttar Pradesh, kathakali and mohiniyattam of Kerala, kuchipudi of Andhra Pradesh, manipuri of Manipur, odissi of Odisha, and the sattriya of Assam.[422]\\nTheatre in India melds music, dance, and improvised or written dialogue.[423] Often based on Hindu mythology, but also borrowing from medieval romances or social and political events, Indian theatre includes: the bhavai of Gujarat, the jatra of West Bengal, the nautanki and ramlila of North India, tamasha of Maharashtra, burrakatha of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana, terukkuttu of Tamil Nadu, and the yakshagana of Karnataka.[424] India has a theatre training institute the National School of Drama (NSD) that is situated at New Delhi It is an autonomous organisation under the Ministry of culture, Government of India.[425]\\nThe Indian film industry produces the world\\'s most-watched cinema.[426] Established regional cinematic traditions exist in the Assamese, Bengali, Bhojpuri, Hindi, Kannada, Malayalam, Punjabi, Gujarati, Marathi, Odia, Tamil, and Telugu languages.[427] The Hindi language film industry (Bollywood) is the largest sector representing 43% of box office revenue, followed by the South Indian Telugu and Tamil film industries which represent 36% combined.[428]\\nTelevision broadcasting began in India in 1959 as a state-run medium of communication and expanded slowly for more than two decades.[429][430] The state monopoly on television broadcast ended in the 1990s. Since then, satellite channels have increasingly shaped the popular culture of Indian society.[431] Today, television is the most penetrative media in India; industry estimates indicate that as of 2012[update] there are over 554 million TV consumers, 462\\xa0million with satellite or cable connections compared to other forms of mass media such as the press (350\\xa0million), radio (156\\xa0million) or internet (37\\xa0million).[432]\\nTraditional Indian society is sometimes defined by social hierarchy. The Indian caste system embodies much of the social stratification and many of the social restrictions found on the Indian subcontinent. Social classes are defined by thousands of endogamous hereditary groups, often termed as jātis, or \"castes\".[433] India abolished untouchability in 1950 with the adoption of the constitution and has since enacted other anti-discriminatory laws and social welfare initiatives.\\nFamily values are important in the Indian tradition, and multi-generational patrilineal joint families have been the norm in India, though nuclear families are becoming common in urban areas.[434] An overwhelming majority of Indians, with their consent, have their marriages arranged by their parents or other family elders.[435] Marriage is thought to be for life,[435] and the divorce rate is extremely low,[436] with less than one in a thousand marriages ending in divorce.[437] Child marriages are common, especially in rural areas; many women wed before reaching 18, which is their legal marriageable age.[438] Female infanticide in India, and lately female foeticide, have created skewed gender ratios; the number of missing women in the country quadrupled from 15 million to 63 million in the 50-year period ending in 2014, faster than the population growth during the same period, and constituting 20 percent of India\\'s female electorate.[439] Accord to an Indian government study, an additional 21 million girls are unwanted and do not receive adequate care.[440] Despite a government ban on sex-selective foeticide, the practice remains commonplace in India, the result of a preference for boys in a patriarchal society.[441] The payment of dowry, although illegal, remains widespread across class lines.[442] Deaths resulting from dowry, mostly from bride burning, are on the rise, despite stringent anti-dowry laws.[443]\\nMany Indian festivals are religious in origin. The best known include: Diwali, Ganesh Chaturthi, Thai Pongal, Holi, Durga Puja, Eid ul-Fitr, Bakr-Id, Christmas, and Vaisakhi.[444][445]\\nIn the 2011 census, about 73% of the population was literate, with 81% for men and 65% for women. This compares to 1981 when the respective rates were 41%, 53% and 29%. In 1951 the rates were 18%, 27% and 9%. In 1921 the rates 7%, 12% and 2%. In 1891 they were 5%, 9% and 1%,[446][447] According to Latika Chaudhary, in 1911 there were under three primary schools for every ten villages. Statistically, more caste and religious diversity reduced private spending. Primary schools taught literacy, so local diversity limited its growth.[448]\\nThe education system of India is the world\\'s second-largest.[449] India has over 900 universities, 40,000 colleges[450] and 1.5 million schools.[451] In India\\'s higher education system, a significant number of seats are reserved under affirmative action policies for the historically disadvantaged. In recent decades India\\'s improved education system is often cited as one of the main contributors to its economic development.[452][453]\\nFrom ancient times until the advent of the modern, the most widely worn traditional dress in India was draped.[454] For women it took the form of a sari, a single piece of cloth many yards long.[454] The sari was traditionally wrapped around the lower body and the shoulder.[454] In its modern form, it is combined with an underskirt, or Indian petticoat, and tucked in the waist band for more secure fastening. It is also commonly worn with an Indian blouse, or choli, which serves as the primary upper-body garment, the sari\\'s end—passing over the shoulder—serving to cover the midriff and obscure the upper body\\'s contours.[454] For men, a similar but shorter length of cloth, the dhoti, has served as a lower-body garment.[455]\\nThe use of stitched clothes became widespread after Muslim rule was established at first by the Delhi sultanate (ca 1300 CE) and then continued by the Mughal Empire (ca 1525 CE).[456] Among the garments introduced during this time and still commonly worn are: the shalwars and pyjamas, both styles of trousers, and the tunics kurta and kameez.[456] In southern India, the traditional draped garments were to see much longer continuous use.[456]\\nShalwars are atypically wide at the waist but narrow to a cuffed bottom. They are held up by a drawstring, which causes them to become pleated around the waist.[457] The pants can be wide and baggy, or they can be cut quite narrow, on the bias, in which case they are called churidars. When they are ordinarily wide at the waist and their bottoms are hemmed but not cuffed, they are called pyjamas. The kameez is a long shirt or tunic,[458] its side seams left open below the waist-line.[459]  The kurta is traditionally collarless and made of cotton or silk; it is worn plain or with embroidered decoration, such as chikan; and typically falls to either just above or just below the wearer\\'s knees.[460]\\nIn the last 50 years, fashions have changed a great deal in India. Increasingly, in urban northern India, the sari is no longer the apparel of everyday wear, though they remain popular on formal occasions.[461] The traditional shalwar kameez is rarely worn by younger urban women, who favour churidars or jeans.[461]  In white-collar office settings, ubiquitous air conditioning allows men to wear sports jackets year-round.[461] For weddings and formal occasions, men in the middle- and upper classes often wear bandgala, or short Nehru jackets, with pants, with the groom and his groomsmen sporting sherwanis and churidars.[461] The dhoti, once the universal garment of Hindu males, the wearing of which in the homespun and handwoven khadi allowed Gandhi to bring Indian nationalism to the millions,[462]\\nis seldom seen in the cities.[461]\\nThe foundation of a typical Indian meal is a cereal cooked in a plain fashion and complemented with flavourful savoury dishes.[463] The cooked cereal could be steamed rice; chapati, a thin unleavened bread made from wheat flour, or occasionally cornmeal, and griddle-cooked dry;[464] the idli, a steamed breakfast cake, or dosa, a griddled pancake, both leavened and made from a batter of rice- and gram meal.[465]  The savoury dishes might include lentils, pulses and vegetables commonly spiced with ginger and garlic, but also with a combination of spices that may include coriander, cumin, turmeric, cinnamon, cardamon and others as informed by culinary conventions.[463] They might also include poultry, fish, or meat dishes. In some instances, the ingredients might be mixed during the process of cooking.[466]\\nA platter, or thali, used for eating usually has a central place reserved for the cooked cereal, and peripheral ones for the flavourful accompaniments, which are often served in small bowls. The cereal and its accompaniments are eaten simultaneously rather than a piecemeal manner.  This is accomplished by mixing—for example of rice and lentils—or folding, wrapping, scooping or dipping—such as chapati and cooked vegetables or lentils.[463]\\nIndia has distinctive vegetarian cuisines, each a feature of the geographical and cultural histories of its adherents.[468] The appearance of ahimsa, or the avoidance of violence toward all forms of life in many religious orders early in Indian history, especially Upanishadic Hinduism, Buddhism and Jainism, is thought to have contributed to the predominance of vegetarianism among a large segment of India\\'s Hindu population, especially in southern India, Gujarat, the Hindi-speaking belt of north-central India, as well as among Jains.[468]  Although meat is eaten widely in India,  the proportional consumption of meat in the overall diet is low.[469] Unlike China, which has increased its per capita meat consumption substantially in its years of increased economic growth, in India the strong dietary traditions have contributed to dairy, rather than meat, becoming the preferred form of animal protein consumption.[470]\\nThe most significant import of cooking techniques into India during the last millennium occurred during the Mughal Empire. Dishes such as the pilaf,[471] developed in the Abbasid caliphate,[472] and cooking techniques such as the marinating of meat in yogurt, spread into northern India from regions to its northwest.[473]  To the simple yogurt marinade of Persia, onions, garlic, almonds, and spices began to be added in India.[473] Rice was partially cooked and layered alternately with the sauteed meat, the pot sealed tightly, and slow cooked according to another Persian cooking technique, to produce what has today become the Indian biryani,[473] a feature of festive dining in many parts of India.[474] In the food served in Indian restaurants worldwide the diversity of Indian food has been partially concealed by the dominance of Punjabi cuisine. The popularity of tandoori chicken—cooked in the tandoor oven, which had traditionally been used for baking bread in the rural Punjab and the Delhi region, especially among Muslims, but which is originally from Central Asia—dates to the 1950s, and was caused in large part by an entrepreneurial response among people from the Punjab who had been displaced by the 1947 partition of India.[468]\\nSeveral traditional indigenous sports such as kabaddi, kho kho, pehlwani and gilli-danda, and also martial arts, such as Kalarippayattu and marma adi remain popular. Chess is commonly held to have originated in India as chaturaṅga;[476] There has been a rise in the number of Indian grandmasters.[477] Viswanathan Anand became the undisputed Chess World Champion in 2007 and held the status until 2013.[478] Parcheesi is derived from Pachisi another traditional Indian pastime, which in early modern times was played on a giant marble court by Mughal emperor Akbar the Great.[479]\\nCricket is the most popular sport in India.[480] Major domestic competitions include the Indian Premier League, which is the most-watched cricket league in the world and ranks sixth among all sports leagues.[481] Other professional leagues include the Indian Super League (football) and the pro Kabaddi league.[482][483][484]\\nIndia has won two ODI Cricket world cups, the 1983 edition and the 2011 edition and has eight field hockey gold medals in the summer olympics[485]\\nThe improved results garnered by the Indian Davis Cup team and other Indian tennis players in the early 2010s have made tennis increasingly popular in the country.[486] India has a comparatively strong presence in shooting sports, and has won several medals at the Olympics, the World Shooting Championships, and the Commonwealth Games.[487][488] Other sports in which Indians have succeeded internationally include badminton[489] (Saina Nehwal and P. V. Sindhu are two of the top-ranked female badminton players in the world), boxing,[490] and wrestling.[491] Football is popular in West Bengal, Goa, Tamil Nadu, Kerala, and the north-eastern states.[492]\\nIndia has hosted or co-hosted several international sporting events: the 1951 and 1982 Asian Games; the 1987, 1996, and 2011 Cricket World Cup tournaments; the 2003 Afro-Asian Games; the 2006 ICC Champions Trophy; the 2009 World Badminton Championships; the 2010 Hockey World Cup; the 2010 Commonwealth Games; and the 2017 FIFA U-17 World Cup. Major international sporting events held annually in India include the Maharashtra Open, the Mumbai Marathon, the Delhi Half Marathon, and the Indian Masters. The first Formula 1 Indian Grand Prix featured in late 2011 but has been discontinued from the F1 season calendar since 2014.[493] India has traditionally been the dominant country at the South Asian Games. An example of this dominance is the basketball competition where the Indian team won three out of four tournaments to date.[494]\\nOverview\\nEtymology\\nHistory\\nGeography\\nBiodiversity\\nPolitics\\nForeign relations and military\\nEconomy\\nDemographics\\nArt\\nCulture\\nGovernment\\nGeneral information\\nCoordinates: 21°N 78°E\\ufeff / \\ufeff21°N 78°E\\ufeff / 21; 78\\nWith 189 member countries, staff from more than 170 countries, and offices in over 130 locations, the World Bank Group is a unique global partnership: five institutions working for sustainable solutions that reduce poverty and build shared prosperity in developing countries. \\xa0The World Bank Group works in every major area of development. \\xa0We provide a wide array of financial products and technical assistance, and we help countries share and apply innovative knowledge and solutions to the challenges they face.We face big challenges to help the world’s poorest people and ensure that everyone sees benefits from economic growth.

It is the seventh-largest country by area, the second-most populous country, and the most populous democracy in the world. Bounded by the Indian Ocean on the south, the Arabian Sea on the southwest, and the Bay of Bengal on the southeast, it shares land borders with Pakistan to the west;[f] China, Nepal, and Bhutan to the north; and Bangladesh and Myanmar to the east. In the Indian Ocean, India is in the vicinity of Sri Lanka and the Maldives; its Andaman and Nicobar Islands share a maritime border with Thailand, Myanmar and Indonesia.\\nModern humans arrived on the Indian subcontinent from Africa no later than 55,000 years ago.[27][28][29]\\nTheir long occupation, initially in varying forms of isolation as hunter-gatherers, has made the region highly diverse, second only to Africa in human genetic diversity.[30] Settled life emerged on the subcontinent in the western margins of the Indus river basin 9,000 years ago, evolving gradually into the Indus Valley civilisation of the third millennium BCE.[31]\\nBy 1200\\xa0BCE, an archaic form of Sanskrit, an Indo-European language, had diffused into India from the northwest,[32][33] unfolding as the language of the Rigveda, and recording the dawning of Hinduism in India.[34] The Dravidian languages of India were supplanted in the northern and western regions.[35]\\nBy 400\\xa0BCE, stratification and exclusion by caste had emerged within Hinduism,[36]\\nand Buddhism and Jainism had arisen, proclaiming social orders unlinked to heredity.[37]\\nEarly political consolidations gave rise to the loose-knit Maurya and Gupta Empires based in the Ganges Basin.[38]\\nTheir collective era was suffused with wide-ranging creativity,[39] but also marked by the declining status of women,[40] and the incorporation of untouchability into an organised system of belief.[g][41] In South India, the Middle kingdoms exported Dravidian-languages scripts and religious cultures to the kingdoms of Southeast Asia.[42]\\nIn the early medieval era, Christianity, Islam, Judaism, and Zoroastrianism became established on India\\'s southern and western coasts.[43]\\nMuslim armies from Central Asia intermittently overran India\\'s northern plains,[44]\\neventually founding the Delhi Sultanate, and drawing northern India into the cosmopolitan networks of medieval Islam.[45]\\nIn the 15th century, the Vijayanagara Empire created a long-lasting composite Hindu culture in south India.[46]\\nIn the Punjab, Sikhism emerged, rejecting institutionalised religion.[47]\\nThe Mughal Empire, in 1526, ushered in two centuries of relative peace,[48]\\nleaving a legacy of luminous architecture.[h][49]\\nGradually expanding rule of the British East India Company followed, turning India into a colonial economy, but also consolidating its sovereignty.[50] British Crown rule began in 1858. The rights promised to Indians were granted slowly,[51][52] but technological changes were introduced, and ideas of education, modernity and the public life took root.[53] A pioneering and influential nationalist movement emerged, which was noted for nonviolent resistance and became the major factor in ending British rule.[54][55] In 1947 the British Indian Empire was partitioned into two independent dominions,[56][57][58][59] a Hindu-majority Dominion of India and a Muslim-majority Dominion of Pakistan, amid large-scale loss of life and an unprecedented migration.[60]\\nIndia has been a federal republic since 1950, governed in a democratic parliamentary system. It is a pluralistic, multilingual and multi-ethnic society. India\\'s population grew from 361 million in 1951 to 1.211\\xa0billion in 2011.[61]\\nDuring the same time, its nominal per capita income increased from US$64 annually to US$1,498, and its literacy rate from 16.6% to 74%. From being a comparatively destitute country in 1951,[62]\\nIndia has become a fast-growing major economy and a hub for information technology services, with an expanding middle class.[63] It has a space programme which includes several planned or completed extraterrestrial missions. Indian movies, music, and spiritual teachings play an increasing role in global culture.[64]\\nIndia has substantially reduced its rate of poverty, though at the cost of increasing economic inequality.[65]\\nIndia is a nuclear-weapon state, which ranks high in military expenditure. It has disputes over Kashmir with its neighbours, Pakistan and China, unresolved since the mid-20th century.[66]\\nAmong the socio-economic challenges India faces are gender inequality, child malnutrition,[67]\\nand rising levels of air pollution.[68]\\nIndia\\'s land is megadiverse, with four biodiversity hotspots.[69] Its forest cover comprises 21.7% of its area.[70] India\\'s wildlife, which has traditionally been viewed with tolerance in India\\'s culture,[71] is supported among these forests, and elsewhere, in protected habitats.\\nAccording to the Oxford English Dictionary (third edition 2009), the name \"India\" is derived from the Classical Latin India, a reference to South Asia and an uncertain region to its east; and in turn derived successively from: Hellenistic Greek India ( Ἰνδία); ancient Greek Indos ( Ἰνδός); Old Persian Hindush, an eastern province of the Achaemenid empire; and ultimately its cognate, the Sanskrit Sindhu, or \"river,\" specifically the Indus River and, by implication, its well-settled southern basin.[72][73] The ancient Greeks referred to the Indians as Indoi (Ἰνδοί), which translates as \"The people of the Indus\".[74]\\nThe term Bharat (Bhārat; pronounced\\xa0[ˈbʱaːɾət] (listen)), mentioned in both Indian epic poetry and the Constitution of India,[75][76] is used in its variations by many Indian languages. A modern rendering of the historical name Bharatavarsha, which applied originally to North India,[77][78] Bharat gained increased currency from the mid-19th century as a native name for India.[75][79]\\nHindustan ([ɦɪndʊˈstaːn] (listen)) is a Middle Persian name for India, introduced during the Mughal Empire and used widely since. Its meaning has varied, referring to a region encompassing present-day northern India and Pakistan or to India in its near entirety.[75][79][80]\\nBy 55,000 years ago, the first modern humans, or Homo sapiens, had arrived on the Indian subcontinent from Africa, where they had earlier evolved.[27][28][29] The earliest known modern human remains in South Asia date to about 30,000 years ago.[27] After 6500\\xa0BCE, evidence for domestication of food crops and animals, construction of permanent structures, and storage of agricultural surplus appeared in Mehrgarh and other sites in what is now Balochistan, Pakistan.[82] These gradually developed into the Indus Valley civilisation,[83][82] the first urban culture in South Asia,[84] which flourished during 2500–1900\\xa0BCE in what is now Pakistan and western India.[85] Centred around cities such as Mohenjo-daro, Harappa, Dholavira, and Kalibangan, and relying on varied forms of subsistence, the civilisation engaged robustly in crafts production and wide-ranging trade.[84]\\nDuring the period 2000–500\\xa0BCE, many regions of the subcontinent transitioned from the Chalcolithic cultures to the Iron Age ones.[86] The Vedas, the oldest scriptures associated with Hinduism,[87] were composed during this period,[88] and historians have analysed these to posit a Vedic culture in the Punjab region and the upper Gangetic Plain.[86] Most historians also consider this period to have encompassed several waves of Indo-Aryan migration into the subcontinent from the north-west.[87] The caste system, which created a hierarchy of priests, warriors, and free peasants, but which excluded indigenous peoples by labelling their occupations impure, arose during this period.[89] On the Deccan Plateau, archaeological evidence from this period suggests the existence of a chiefdom stage of political organisation.[86] In South India, a progression to sedentary life is indicated by the large number of megalithic monuments dating from this period,[90] as well as by nearby traces of agriculture, irrigation tanks, and craft traditions.[90]\\nIn the late Vedic period, around the 6th century BCE, the small states and chiefdoms of the Ganges Plain and the north-western regions had consolidated into 16 major oligarchies and monarchies that were known as the mahajanapadas.[91][92] The emerging urbanisation gave rise to non-Vedic religious movements, two of which became independent religions. Jainism came into prominence during the life of its exemplar, Mahavira.[93] Buddhism, based on the teachings of Gautama Buddha, attracted followers from all social classes excepting the middle class; chronicling the life of the Buddha was central to the beginnings of recorded history in India.[94][95][96] In an age of increasing urban wealth, both religions held up renunciation as an ideal,[97] and both established long-lasting monastic traditions. Politically, by the 3rd century BCE, the kingdom of Magadha had annexed or reduced other states to emerge as the Mauryan Empire.[98] The empire was once thought to have controlled most of the subcontinent except the far south, but its core regions are now thought to have been separated by large autonomous areas.[99][100] The Mauryan kings are known as much for their empire-building and determined management of public life as for Ashoka\\'s renunciation of militarism and far-flung advocacy of the Buddhist dhamma.[101][102]\\nThe Sangam literature of the Tamil language reveals that, between 200\\xa0BCE and 200\\xa0CE, the southern peninsula was ruled by the Cheras, the Cholas, and the Pandyas, dynasties that traded extensively with the Roman Empire and with West and South-East Asia.[103][104] In North India, Hinduism asserted patriarchal control within the family, leading to increased subordination of women.[105][98] By the 4th and 5th centuries, the Gupta Empire had created a complex system of administration and taxation in the greater Ganges Plain; this system became a model for later Indian kingdoms.[106][107] Under the Guptas, a renewed Hinduism based on devotion, rather than the management of ritual, began to assert itself.[108] This renewal was reflected in a flowering of sculpture and architecture, which found patrons among an urban elite.[107] Classical Sanskrit literature flowered as well, and Indian science, astronomy, medicine, and mathematics made significant advances.[107]\\nThe Indian early medieval age, from 600 to 1200\\xa0CE, is defined by regional kingdoms and cultural diversity.[109] When Harsha of Kannauj, who ruled much of the Indo-Gangetic Plain from 606 to 647\\xa0CE, attempted to expand southwards, he was defeated by the Chalukya ruler of the Deccan.[110] When his successor attempted to expand eastwards, he was defeated by the Pala king of Bengal.[110] When the Chalukyas attempted to expand southwards, they were defeated by the Pallavas from farther south, who in turn were opposed by the Pandyas and the Cholas from still farther south.[110] No ruler of this period was able to create an empire and consistently control lands much beyond their core region.[109] During this time, pastoral peoples, whose land had been cleared to make way for the growing agricultural economy, were accommodated within caste society, as were new non-traditional ruling classes.[111] The caste system consequently began to show regional differences.[111]\\nIn the 6th and 7th centuries, the first devotional hymns were created in the Tamil language.[112] They were imitated all over India and led to both the resurgence of Hinduism and the development of all modern languages of the subcontinent.[112] Indian royalty, big and small, and the temples they patronised drew citizens in great numbers to the capital cities, which became economic hubs as well.[113] Temple towns of various sizes began to appear everywhere as India underwent another urbanisation.[113] By the 8th and 9th centuries, the effects were felt in South-East Asia, as South Indian culture and political systems were exported to lands that became part of modern-day Myanmar, Thailand, Laos, Brunei, Cambodia, Vietnam, Philippines, Malaysia, and Indonesia.[114] Indian merchants, scholars, and sometimes armies were involved in this transmission; South-East Asians took the initiative as well, with many sojourning in Indian seminaries and translating Buddhist and Hindu texts into their languages.[114]\\nAfter the 10th century, Muslim Central Asian nomadic clans, using swift-horse cavalry and raising vast armies united by ethnicity and religion, repeatedly overran South Asia\\'s north-western plains, leading eventually to the establishment of the Islamic Delhi Sultanate in 1206.[115] The sultanate was to control much of North India and to make many forays into South India. Although at first disruptive for the Indian elites, the sultanate largely left its vast non-Muslim subject population to its own laws and customs.[116][117] By repeatedly repulsing Mongol raiders in the 13th century, the sultanate saved India from the devastation visited on West and Central Asia, setting the scene for centuries of migration of fleeing soldiers, learned men, mystics, traders, artists, and artisans from that region into the subcontinent, thereby creating a syncretic Indo-Islamic culture in the north.[118][119] The sultanate\\'s raiding and weakening of the regional kingdoms of South India paved the way for the indigenous Vijayanagara Empire.[120] Embracing a strong Shaivite tradition and building upon the military technology of the sultanate, the empire came to control much of peninsular India,[121] and was to influence South Indian society for long afterwards.[120]\\nIn the early 16th century, northern India, then under mainly Muslim rulers,[122] fell again to the superior mobility and firepower of a new generation of Central Asian warriors.[123] The resulting Mughal Empire did not stamp out the local societies it came to rule. Instead, it balanced and pacified them through new administrative practices[124][125] and diverse and inclusive ruling elites,[126] leading to more systematic, centralised, and uniform rule.[127] Eschewing tribal bonds and Islamic identity, especially under Akbar, the Mughals united their far-flung realms through loyalty, expressed through a Persianised culture, to an emperor who had near-divine status.[126] The Mughal state\\'s economic policies, deriving most revenues from agriculture[128] and mandating that taxes be paid in the well-regulated silver currency,[129] caused peasants and artisans to enter larger markets.[127] The relative peace maintained by the empire during much of the 17th century was a factor in India\\'s economic expansion,[127] resulting in greater patronage of painting, literary forms, textiles, and architecture.[130] Newly coherent social groups in northern and western India, such as the Marathas, the Rajputs, and the Sikhs, gained military and governing ambitions during Mughal rule, which, through collaboration or adversity, gave them both recognition and military experience.[131] Expanding commerce during Mughal rule gave rise to new Indian commercial and political elites along the coasts of southern and eastern India.[131] As the empire disintegrated, many among these elites were able to seek and control their own affairs.[132]\\nBy the early 18th century, with the lines between commercial and political dominance being increasingly blurred, a number of European trading companies, including the English East India Company, had established coastal outposts.[133][134] The East India Company\\'s control of the seas, greater resources, and more advanced military training and technology led it to increasingly assert its military strength and caused it to become attractive to a portion of the Indian elite; these factors were crucial in allowing the company to gain control over the Bengal region by 1765 and sideline the other European companies.[135][133][136][137] Its further access to the riches of Bengal and the subsequent increased strength and size of its army enabled it to annexe or subdue most of India by the 1820s.[138] India was then no longer exporting manufactured goods as it long had, but was instead supplying the British Empire with raw materials. Many historians consider this to be the onset of India\\'s colonial period.[133] By this time, with its economic power severely curtailed by the British parliament and having effectively been made an arm of British administration, the company began more consciously to enter non-economic arenas, including education, social reform and culture.[139]\\nHistorians consider India\\'s modern age to have begun sometime between 1848 and 1885. The appointment in 1848 of Lord Dalhousie as Governor General of the East India Company set the stage for changes essential to a modern state. These included the consolidation and demarcation of sovereignty, the surveillance of the population, and the education of citizens. Technological changes—among them, railways, canals, and the telegraph—were introduced not long after their introduction in Europe.[140][141][142][143] However, disaffection with the company also grew during this time and set off the Indian Rebellion of 1857. Fed by diverse resentments and perceptions, including invasive British-style social reforms, harsh land taxes, and summary treatment of some rich landowners and princes, the rebellion rocked many regions of northern and central India and shook the foundations of Company rule.[144][145] Although the rebellion was suppressed by 1858, it led to the dissolution of the East India Company and the direct administration of India by the British government. Proclaiming a unitary state and a gradual but limited British-style parliamentary system, the new rulers also protected princes and landed gentry as a feudal safeguard against future unrest.[146][147] In the decades following, public life gradually emerged all over India, leading eventually to the founding of the Indian National Congress in 1885.[148][149][150][151]\\nThe rush of technology and the commercialisation of agriculture in the second half of the 19th century was marked by economic setbacks and many small farmers became dependent on the whims of far-away markets.[152] There was an increase in the number of large-scale famines,[153] and, despite the risks of infrastructure development borne by Indian taxpayers, little industrial employment was generated for Indians.[154] There were also salutary effects: commercial cropping, especially in the newly canalled Punjab, led to increased food production for internal consumption.[155] The railway network provided critical famine relief,[156] notably reduced the cost of moving goods,[156] and helped nascent Indian-owned industry.[155]\\nAfter World War I, in which approximately one million Indians served,[157] a new period began. It was marked by British reforms but also repressive legislation, by more strident Indian calls for self-rule, and by the beginnings of a nonviolent movement of non-co-operation, of which Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi would become the leader and enduring symbol.[158] During the 1930s, slow legislative reform was enacted by the British; the Indian National Congress won victories in the resulting elections.[159] The next decade was beset with crises: Indian participation in World War\\xa0II, the Congress\\'s final push for non-co-operation, and an upsurge of Muslim nationalism. All were capped by the advent of independence in 1947, but tempered by the partition of India into two states: India and Pakistan.[160]\\nVital to India\\'s self-image as an independent nation was its constitution, completed in 1950, which put in place a secular and democratic republic.[161] It has remained a democracy with civil liberties, an active supreme court, and a largely independent press.[dubious  – discuss][162] Economic liberalisation, which began in the 1990s, has created a large urban middle class, transformed India into one of the world\\'s fastest-growing economies,[163] and increased its geopolitical clout. Indian movies, music, and spiritual teachings play an increasing role in global culture.[162] Yet, India is also shaped by seemingly unyielding poverty, both rural and urban;[162] by religious and caste-related violence;[164] by Maoist-inspired Naxalite insurgencies;[165] and by separatism in Jammu and Kashmir and in Northeast India.[166] It has unresolved territorial disputes with China[167] and with Pakistan.[167] India\\'s sustained democratic freedoms are unique among the world\\'s newer nations; however, in spite of its recent economic successes, freedom from want for its disadvantaged population remains a goal yet to be achieved.[168]\\nIndia accounts for the bulk of the Indian subcontinent, lying atop the Indian tectonic plate, a part of the Indo-Australian Plate.[169] India\\'s defining geological processes began 75 million years ago when the Indian Plate, then part of the southern supercontinent Gondwana, began a north-eastward drift caused by seafloor spreading to its south-west, and later, south and south-east.[169] Simultaneously, the vast Tethyan oceanic crust, to its northeast, began to subduct under the Eurasian Plate.[169] These dual processes, driven by convection in the Earth\\'s mantle, both created the Indian Ocean and caused the Indian continental crust eventually to under-thrust Eurasia and to uplift the Himalayas.[169] Immediately south of the emerging Himalayas, plate movement created a vast crescent-shaped trough that rapidly filled with river-borne sediment[170] and now constitutes the Indo-Gangetic Plain.[171]   The original Indian plate makes its first appearance above the sediment in the ancient Aravalli range, which extends from the Delhi Ridge in a southwesterly direction. To the west lies the Thar desert, the eastern spread of which is checked by the Aravallis.[172][173][174]\\nThe remaining Indian Plate survives as peninsular India, the oldest and geologically most stable part of India. It extends as far north as the Satpura and Vindhya ranges in central India. These parallel chains run from the Arabian Sea coast in Gujarat in the west to the coal-rich Chota Nagpur Plateau in Jharkhand in the east.[176] To the south, the remaining peninsular landmass, the Deccan Plateau, is flanked on the west and east by coastal ranges known as the Western and Eastern Ghats;[177] the plateau contains the country\\'s oldest rock formations, some over one billion years old. Constituted in such fashion, India lies to the north of the equator between 6° 44′ and 35° 30′ north latitude[i] and 68° 7′ and 97° 25′ east longitude.[178]\\nIndia\\'s coastline measures 7,517 kilometres (4,700\\xa0mi) in length; of this distance, 5,423 kilometres (3,400\\xa0mi) belong to peninsular India and 2,094 kilometres (1,300\\xa0mi) to the Andaman, Nicobar, and Lakshadweep island chains.[179] According to the Indian naval hydrographic charts, the mainland coastline consists of the following: 43% sandy beaches; 11% rocky shores, including cliffs; and 46% mudflats or marshy shores.[179]\\nMajor Himalayan-origin rivers that substantially flow through India include the Ganges and the Brahmaputra, both of which drain into the Bay of Bengal.[180] Important tributaries of the Ganges include the Yamuna and the Kosi; the latter\\'s extremely low gradient, caused by long-term silt deposition, leads to severe floods and course changes.[181][182] Major peninsular rivers, whose steeper gradients prevent their waters from flooding, include the Godavari, the Mahanadi, the Kaveri, and the Krishna, which also drain into the Bay of Bengal;[183] and the Narmada and the Tapti, which drain into the Arabian Sea.[184] Coastal features include the marshy Rann of Kutch of western India and the alluvial Sundarbans delta of eastern India; the latter is shared with Bangladesh.[185] India has two archipelagos: the Lakshadweep, coral atolls off India\\'s south-western coast; and the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, a volcanic chain in the Andaman Sea.[186]\\nIndian climate is strongly influenced by the Himalayas and the Thar Desert, both of which drive the economically and culturally pivotal summer and winter monsoons.[187] The Himalayas prevent cold Central Asian katabatic winds from blowing in, keeping the bulk of the Indian subcontinent warmer than most locations at similar latitudes.[188][189] The Thar Desert plays a crucial role in attracting the moisture-laden south-west summer monsoon winds that, between June and October, provide the majority of India\\'s rainfall.[187] Four major climatic groupings predominate in India: tropical wet, tropical dry, subtropical humid, and montane.[190]\\nTemperatures in India have risen by 0.7\\xa0°C (1.3\\xa0°F) between 1901 and 2018.[191] Climate change in India is often thought to be the cause. The retreat of Himalayan glaciers has adversely affected the flow rate of the major Himalayan rivers, including the Ganges and the Brahmaputra.[192] According to some current projections, the number and severity of droughts in India will have markedly increased by the end of the present century.[193]\\nIndia is a megadiverse country, a term employed for 17 countries which display high biological diversity and contain many species exclusively indigenous, or endemic, to them.[196] India is a habitat for 8.6% of all mammal species, 13.7% of bird species, 7.9% of reptile species, 6% of amphibian species, 12.2% of fish species, and 6.0% of all flowering plant species.[197][198] Fully a third of Indian plant species are endemic.[199] India also contains four of the world\\'s 34 biodiversity hotspots,[69] or regions that display significant habitat loss in the presence of high endemism.[k][200]\\nAccording to official statistics, India\\'s forest cover is 713,789\\xa0km2 (275,595\\xa0sq\\xa0mi), which is 21.71% of the country\\'s total land area.[70] It can be subdivided further into broad categories of canopy density, or the proportion of the area of a forest covered by its tree canopy.[201] Very dense forest, whose canopy density is greater than 70%, occupies 3.02% of India\\'s land area.[201][202] It predominates in the tropical moist forest of the Andaman Islands, the Western Ghats, and Northeast India.[195] Moderately dense forest, whose canopy density is between 40% and 70%, occupies 9.39% of India\\'s land area.[201][202] It predominates in the temperate coniferous forest of the Himalayas, the moist deciduous sal forest of eastern India, and the dry deciduous teak forest of central and southern India.[195] Open forest, whose canopy density is between 10% and 40%, occupies 9.26% of India\\'s land area.[201][202] India has two natural zones of thorn forest, one in the Deccan Plateau, immediately east of the Western Ghats, and the other in the western part of the Indo-Gangetic plain, now turned into rich agricultural land by irrigation, its features no longer visible.[203]\\nAmong the Indian subcontinent\\'s notable indigenous trees are the astringent Azadirachta indica, or neem, which is widely used in rural Indian herbal medicine,[204] and the luxuriant Ficus religiosa, or peepul,[205] which is displayed on the ancient seals of Mohenjo-daro,[206] and under which the Buddha is recorded in the Pali canon to have sought enlightenment.[207]\\nMany Indian species have descended from those of Gondwana, the southern supercontinent from which India separated more than 100 million years ago.[208] India\\'s subsequent collision with Eurasia set off a mass exchange of species. However, volcanism and climatic changes later caused the extinction of many endemic Indian forms.[209] Still later, mammals entered India from Asia through two zoogeographical passes flanking the Himalayas.[195] This had the effect of lowering endemism among India\\'s mammals, which stands at 12.6%, contrasting with 45.8% among reptiles and 55.8% among amphibians.[198]} Among endemics are the vulnerable[210] hooded leaf monkey[211] and the threatened[212] Beddome\\'s toad[212][213] of the Western Ghats.\\nIndia contains 172 IUCN-designated threatened animal species, or 2.9% of endangered forms.[214] These include the endangered Bengal tiger and the Ganges river dolphin. Critically endangered species include: the gharial, a crocodilian; the great Indian bustard; and the Indian white-rumped vulture, which has become nearly extinct by having ingested the carrion of diclofenac-treated cattle.[215] Before they were extensively utilized for agriculture and cleared for human settlement, the thorn forests of Punjab were mingled at intervals with open grasslands that were grazed by large herds of blackbuck preyed on by the Asiatic cheetah; the blackbuck, no longer extant in Punjab, is now severely endangered in India, and the cheetah is extinct.[216] The pervasive and ecologically devastating human encroachment of recent decades has critically endangered Indian wildlife. In response, the system of national parks and protected areas, first established in 1935, was expanded substantially. In 1972, India enacted the Wildlife Protection Act[217] and Project Tiger to safeguard crucial wilderness; the Forest Conservation Act was enacted in 1980 and amendments added in 1988.[218] India hosts more than five hundred wildlife sanctuaries and thirteen\\xa0biosphere reserves,[219] four of which are part of the World Network of Biosphere Reserves; twenty-five wetlands are registered under the Ramsar Convention.[220]\\nIndia is the world\\'s most populous democracy.[222] A parliamentary republic with a multi-party system,[223] it has eight\\xa0recognised national parties, including the Indian National Congress and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), and more than 40\\xa0regional parties.[224] The Congress is considered centre-left in Indian political culture,[225] and the BJP right-wing.[226][227][228] For most of the period between 1950—when India first became a republic—and the late 1980s, the Congress held a majority in the parliament. Since then, however, it has increasingly shared the political stage with the BJP,[229] as well as with powerful regional parties which have often forced the creation of multi-party coalition governments at the centre.[230]\\nIn the Republic of India\\'s first three general elections, in 1951, 1957, and 1962, the Jawaharlal Nehru-led Congress won easy victories. On Nehru\\'s death in 1964, Lal Bahadur Shastri briefly became prime minister; he was succeeded, after his own unexpected death in 1966, by Nehru\\'s daughter Indira Gandhi, who went on to lead the Congress to election victories in 1967 and 1971. Following public discontent with the state of emergency she declared in 1975, the Congress was voted out of power in 1977; the then-new Janata Party, which had opposed the emergency, was voted in. Its government lasted just over two years. Voted back into power in 1980, the Congress saw a change in leadership in 1984, when Indira Gandhi was assassinated; she was succeeded by her son Rajiv Gandhi, who won an easy victory in the general elections later that year. The Congress was voted out again in 1989 when a National Front coalition, led by the newly formed Janata Dal in alliance with the Left Front, won the elections; that government too proved relatively short-lived, lasting just under two years.[231] Elections were held again in 1991; no party won an absolute majority. The Congress, as the largest single party, was able to form a minority government led by P. V. Narasimha Rao.[232]\\nA two-year period of political turmoil followed the general election of 1996. Several short-lived alliances shared power at the centre. The BJP formed a government briefly in 1996; it was followed by two comparatively long-lasting United Front coalitions, which depended on external support. In 1998, the BJP was able to form a successful coalition, the National Democratic Alliance (NDA). Led by Atal Bihari Vajpayee, the NDA became the first non-Congress, coalition government to complete a five-year term.[233] Again in the 2004 Indian general elections, no party won an absolute majority, but the Congress emerged as the largest single party, forming another successful coalition: the United Progressive Alliance (UPA). It had the support of left-leaning parties and MPs who opposed the BJP. The UPA returned to power in the 2009 general election with increased numbers, and it no longer required external support from India\\'s communist parties.[234] That year, Manmohan Singh became the first prime minister since Jawaharlal Nehru in 1957 and 1962 to be re-elected to a consecutive five-year term.[235] In the 2014 general election, the BJP became the first political party since 1984 to win a majority and govern without the support of other parties.[236] The incumbent prime minister is Narendra Modi, a former chief minister of Gujarat. On 20 July 2017, Ram Nath Kovind was elected India\\'s 14th president and took the oath of office on 25 July 2017.[237]\\nIndia is a federation with a parliamentary system governed under the Constitution of India—the country\\'s supreme legal document. It is a constitutional republic and representative democracy, in which \"majority rule is tempered by minority rights protected by law\". Federalism in India defines the power distribution between the union and the states. The Constitution of India, which came into effect on 26 January 1950,[239] originally stated India to be a \"sovereign, democratic republic;\" this characterisation was amended in 1971 to \"a sovereign, socialist, secular, democratic republic\".[240] India\\'s form of government, traditionally described as \"quasi-federal\" with a strong centre and weak states,[241] has grown increasingly federal since the late 1990s as a result of political, economic, and social changes.[242][243]\\nThe Government of India comprises three branches:[244]\\nIndia is a federal union comprising 28 states and 8 union territories.[16] All states, as well as the union territories of Jammu and Kashmir, Puducherry and the National Capital Territory of Delhi, have elected legislatures and governments following the Westminster system of governance. The remaining five union territories are directly ruled by the central government through appointed administrators. In 1956, under the States Reorganisation Act, states were reorganised on a linguistic basis.[260] There are over a quarter of a million local government bodies at city, town, block, district and village levels.[261]\\n\\nIn the 1950s, India strongly supported decolonisation in Africa and Asia and played a leading role in the Non-Aligned Movement.[263] After initially cordial relations with neighbouring China, India went to war with China in 1962, and was widely thought to have been humiliated.[264] India has had tense relations with neighbouring Pakistan; the two nations have gone to war four times: in 1947, 1965, 1971, and 1999. Three of these wars were fought over the disputed territory of Kashmir, while the fourth, the 1971 war, followed from India\\'s support for the independence of Bangladesh.[265] In the late 1980s, the Indian military twice intervened abroad at the invitation of the host country: a peace-keeping operation in Sri Lanka between 1987 and 1990; and an armed intervention to prevent a 1988 coup d\\'état attempt in the Maldives. After the 1965 war with Pakistan, India began to pursue close military and economic ties with the Soviet Union; by the late 1960s, the Soviet Union was its largest arms supplier.[266]\\nAside from ongoing its special relationship with Russia,[267] India has wide-ranging defence relations with Israel and France. In recent years, it has played key roles in the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation and the World Trade Organization. The nation has provided 100,000 military and police personnel to serve in 35 UN peacekeeping operations across four continents. It participates in the East Asia Summit, the G8+5, and other multilateral forums.[268] India has close economic ties with countries in South America,[269] Asia, and Africa; it pursues a \"Look East\" policy that seeks to strengthen partnerships with the ASEAN nations, Japan, and South Korea that revolve around many issues, but especially those involving economic investment and regional security.[270][271]\\nChina\\'s nuclear test of 1964, as well as its repeated threats to intervene in support of Pakistan in the 1965 war, convinced India to develop nuclear weapons.[273] India conducted its first nuclear weapons test in 1974 and carried out additional underground testing in 1998. Despite criticism and military sanctions, India has signed neither the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty nor the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, considering both to be flawed and discriminatory.[274] India maintains a \"no first use\" nuclear policy and is developing a nuclear triad capability as a part of its \"Minimum Credible Deterrence\" doctrine.[275][276] It is developing a ballistic missile defence shield and, a fifth-generation fighter jet.[277][278] Other indigenous military projects involve the design and implementation of Vikrant-class aircraft carriers and Arihant-class nuclear submarines.[279]\\nSince the end of the Cold War, India has increased its economic, strategic, and military co-operation with the United States and the European Union.[280] In 2008, a civilian nuclear agreement was signed between India and the United States. Although India possessed nuclear weapons at the time and was not a party to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, it received waivers from the International Atomic Energy Agency and the Nuclear Suppliers Group, ending earlier restrictions on India\\'s nuclear technology and commerce. As a consequence, India became the sixth de facto nuclear weapons state.[281] India subsequently signed co-operation agreements involving civilian nuclear energy with Russia,[282] France,[283] the United Kingdom,[284] and Canada.[285]\\nThe President of India is the supreme commander of the nation\\'s armed forces; with 1.45\\xa0million active troops, they compose the world\\'s second-largest military. It comprises the Indian Army, the Indian Navy, the Indian Air Force, and the Indian Coast Guard.[286] The official Indian defence budget for 2011 was US$36.03\\xa0billion, or 1.83% of GDP.[287] Defence expenditure was pegged at US$70.12\\xa0billion for fiscal year 2022–23 and, increased 9.8% than previous fiscal year.[288][289] India is the world\\'s second largest arms importer; between 2016 and 2020, it accounted for 9.5% of the total global arms imports.[290] Much of the military expenditure was focused on defence against Pakistan and countering growing Chinese influence in the Indian Ocean.[291] In May 2017, the Indian Space Research Organisation launched the South Asia Satellite, a gift from India to its neighbouring SAARC countries.[292] In October 2018, India signed a US$5.43\\xa0billion (over ₹400\\xa0billion) agreement with Russia to procure four S-400 Triumf surface-to-air missile defence systems, Russia\\'s most advanced long-range missile defence system.[293]\\nAccording to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the Indian economy in 2021 was nominally worth $3.04\\xa0trillion; it is the sixth-largest economy by market exchange rates, and is around $10.219\\xa0trillion, the third-largest by purchasing power parity (PPP).[297] With its average annual GDP growth rate of 5.8% over the past two decades, and reaching 6.1% during 2011–2012,[298] India is one of the world\\'s fastest-growing economies.[299] However, the country ranks 139th in the world in nominal GDP per capita and 118th in GDP per capita at PPP.[300] Until 1991, all Indian governments followed protectionist policies that were influenced by socialist economics. Widespread state intervention and regulation largely walled the economy off from the outside world. An acute balance of payments crisis in 1991 forced the nation to liberalise its economy;[301] since then it has moved slowly towards a free-market system[302][303] by emphasising both foreign trade and direct investment inflows.[304] India has been a member of World Trade Organization since 1 January 1995.[305]\\nThe 522-million-worker Indian labour force is the world\\'s second-largest, as of 2017[update].[286] The service sector makes up 55.6% of GDP, the industrial sector 26.3% and the agricultural sector 18.1%. India\\'s foreign exchange remittances of US$87\\xa0billion in 2021, highest in the world, were contributed to its economy by 32 million Indians working in foreign countries.[306] Major agricultural products include: rice, wheat, oilseed, cotton, jute, tea, sugarcane, and potatoes.[16] Major industries include: textiles, telecommunications, chemicals, pharmaceuticals, biotechnology, food processing, steel, transport equipment, cement, mining, petroleum, machinery, and software.[16] In 2006, the share of external trade in India\\'s GDP stood at 24%, up from 6% in 1985.[302] In 2008, India\\'s share of world trade was 1.68%;[307] In 2011, India was the world\\'s tenth-largest importer and the nineteenth-largest exporter.[308] Major exports include: petroleum products, textile goods, jewellery, software, engineering goods, chemicals, and manufactured leather goods.[16] Major imports include: crude oil, machinery, gems, fertiliser, and chemicals.[16] Between 2001 and 2011, the contribution of petrochemical and engineering goods to total exports grew from 14% to 42%.[309] India was the world\\'s second largest textile exporter after China in the 2013 calendar year.[310]\\nAveraging an economic growth rate of 7.5% for several years prior to 2007,[302] India has more than doubled its hourly wage rates during the first decade of the 21st century.[311] Some 431 million Indians have left poverty since 1985; India\\'s middle classes are projected to number around 580\\xa0million by 2030.[312] Though ranking 51st in global competitiveness, as of 2010[update], India ranks 17th in financial market sophistication, 24th in the banking sector, 44th in business sophistication, and 39th in innovation, ahead of several advanced economies.[313] With seven of the world\\'s top 15 information technology outsourcing companies based in India, as of 2009[update], the country is viewed as the second-most favourable outsourcing destination after the United States.[314] India was ranked 46th in the Global Innovation Index in 2021, it has increased its ranking considerably since 2015, where it was 81st.[315][316][317][318] India\\'s consumer market, the world\\'s eleventh-largest, is expected to become fifth-largest by 2030.[312]\\nDriven by growth, India\\'s nominal GDP per capita increased steadily from US$308 in 1991, when economic liberalisation began, to US$1,380 in 2010, to an estimated US$1,730 in 2016. It is expected to grow to US$2,313 by 2022.[21] However, it has remained lower than those of other Asian developing countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Sri Lanka, and Thailand, and is expected to remain so in the near future.\\nAccording to a 2011 PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) report, India\\'s GDP at purchasing power parity could overtake that of the United States by 2045.[320] During the next four decades, Indian GDP is expected to grow at an annualised average of 8%, making it potentially the world\\'s fastest-growing major economy until 2050.[320] The report highlights key growth factors: a young and rapidly growing working-age population; growth in the manufacturing sector because of rising education and engineering skill levels; and sustained growth of the consumer market driven by a rapidly growing middle-class.[320] The World Bank cautions that, for India to achieve its economic potential, it must continue to focus on public sector reform, transport infrastructure, agricultural and rural development, removal of labour regulations, education, energy security, and public health and nutrition.[321]\\nAccording to the Worldwide Cost of Living Report 2017 released by the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU) which was created by comparing more than 400 individual prices across 160 products and services, four of the cheapest cities were in India: Bangalore (3rd), Mumbai (5th), Chennai (5th) and New Delhi (8th).[322]\\nIndia\\'s telecommunication industry is the second-largest in the world with over 1.2 billion subscribers. It contributes 6.5% to India\\'s GDP.[323] After the third quarter of 2017, India surpassed the US to become the second largest smartphone market in the world after China.[324]\\nThe Indian automotive industry, the world\\'s second-fastest growing, increased domestic sales by 26% during 2009–2010,[325] and exports by 36% during 2008–2009.[326] At the end of 2011, the Indian IT industry employed 2.8\\xa0million professionals, generated revenues close to US$100\\xa0billion equalling 7.5% of Indian GDP, and contributed 26% of India\\'s merchandise exports.[327]\\nThe pharmaceutical industry in India emerged as a global player. As of 2021, with 3000 pharmaceutical companies and 10,500 manufacturing units India is the world\\'s third-largest pharmaceutical producer, largest producer of generic medicines and supply up to 50%—60% of global vaccines demand, these all contribute up to US$24.44\\xa0billions in exports and India\\'s local pharmacutical market is estimated up to US$42\\xa0billion.[328][329] India is among the top 12 biotech destinations in the world.[330][331] The Indian biotech industry grew by 15.1% in 2012–2013, increasing its revenues from ₹204.4\\xa0billion (Indian rupees) to ₹235.24\\xa0billion (US$3.94 billion at June 2013 exchange rates).[332]\\nIndia\\'s capacity to generate electrical power is 300 gigawatts, of which 42 gigawatts is renewable.[333] The country\\'s usage of coal is a major cause of greenhouse gas emissions by India but its renewable energy is competing strongly.[334] India emits about 7% of global greenhouse gas emissions. This equates to about 2.5 tons of carbon dioxide per person per year, which is half the world average.[335][336] Increasing access to electricity and clean cooking with liquefied petroleum gas have been priorities for energy in India.[337]\\nDespite economic growth during recent decades, India continues to face socio-economic challenges. In 2006, India contained the largest number of people living below the World Bank\\'s international poverty line of US$1.25 per day.[339] The proportion decreased from 60% in 1981 to 42% in 2005.[340] Under the World Bank\\'s later revised poverty line, it was 21% in 2011.[l][342] 30.7% of India\\'s children under the age of five are underweight.[343] According to a Food and Agriculture Organization report in 2015, 15% of the population is undernourished.[344][345] The Mid-Day Meal Scheme attempts to lower these rates.[346]\\nA 2018 Walk Free Foundation report estimated that nearly 8\\xa0million people in India were living in different forms of modern slavery, such as bonded labour, child labour, human trafficking, and forced begging, among others.[347] According to the 2011 census, there were 10.1\\xa0million child labourers in the country, a decline of 2.6\\xa0million from 12.6\\xa0million in 2001.[348]\\nSince 1991, economic inequality between India\\'s states has consistently grown: the per-capita net state domestic product of the richest states in 2007 was 3.2 times that of the poorest.[349] Corruption in India is perceived to have decreased. According to the Corruption Perceptions Index, India ranked 78th out of 180 countries in 2018 with a score of 41 out of 100, an improvement from 85th in 2014.[350][351]\\nWith 1,210,193,422 residents reported in the 2011 provisional census report,[352] India is the world\\'s second-most populous country. Its population grew by 17.64% from 2001 to 2011,[353] compared to 21.54% growth in the previous decade (1991–2001).[353] The human sex ratio, according to the 2011 census, is 940 females per 1,000 males.[352] The median age was 28.7 as of 2020[update].[286] The first post-colonial census, conducted in 1951, counted 361\\xa0million people.[354] Medical advances made in the last 50 years as well as increased agricultural productivity brought about by the \"Green Revolution\" have caused India\\'s population to grow rapidly.[355]\\nThe average life expectancy in India is at 70 years—71.5 years for women, 68.7 years for men.[286] There are around 93 physicians per 100,000 people.[356] Migration from rural to urban areas has been an important dynamic in India\\'s recent history. The number of people living in urban areas grew by 31.2% between 1991 and 2001.[357] Yet, in 2001, over 70% still lived in rural areas.[358][359] The level of urbanisation increased further from 27.81% in the 2001 Census to 31.16% in the 2011 Census. The slowing down of the overall population growth rate was due to the sharp decline in the growth rate in rural areas since 1991.[360] According to the 2011 census, there are 53 million-plus urban agglomerations in India; among them Mumbai, Delhi, Kolkata, Chennai, Bangalore, Hyderabad and Ahmedabad, in decreasing order by population.[361] The literacy rate in 2011 was 74.04%: 65.46% among females and 82.14% among males.[362] The rural-urban literacy gap, which was 21.2 percentage points in 2001, dropped to 16.1 percentage points in 2011. The improvement in the rural literacy rate is twice that of urban areas.[360] Kerala is the most literate state with 93.91% literacy; while Bihar the least with 63.82%.[362]\\nIndia is home to two major language families: Indo-Aryan (spoken by about 74% of the population) and Dravidian (spoken by 24% of the population). Other languages spoken in India come from the Austroasiatic and Sino-Tibetan language families. India has no national language.[363] Hindi, with the largest number of speakers, is the official language of the government.[364][365] English is used extensively in business and administration and has the status of a \"subsidiary official language\";[6] it is important in education, especially as a medium of higher education. Each state and union territory has one or more official languages, and the constitution recognises in particular 22 \"scheduled languages\".\\nThe 2011 census reported the religion in India with the largest number of followers was Hinduism (79.80% of the population), followed by Islam (14.23%); the remaining were Christianity (2.30%), Sikhism (1.72%), Buddhism (0.70%), Jainism (0.36%) and others[m] (0.9%).[15] India has the third-largest Muslim population—the largest for a non-Muslim majority country.[366][367]\\nIndian cultural history spans more than 4,500 years.[368] During the Vedic period (c.\\u20091700\\xa0BCE\\xa0– c.\\u2009500\\xa0BCE), the foundations of Hindu philosophy, mythology, theology and literature were laid, and many beliefs and practices which still exist today, such as dhárma, kárma, yóga, and mokṣa, were established.[74] India is notable for its religious diversity, with Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, Islam, Christianity, and Jainism among the nation\\'s major religions.[369] The predominant religion, Hinduism, has been shaped by various historical schools of thought, including those of the Upanishads,[370] the Yoga Sutras, the Bhakti movement,[369] and by Buddhist philosophy.[371]\\nIndia has a very ancient tradition of art, which has exchanged many influences with the rest of Eurasia, especially in the first millennium, when Buddhist art spread with Indian religions to Central, East and South-East Asia, the last also greatly influenced by Hindu art.[372]  Thousands of seals from the Indus Valley Civilization of the third millennium BCE have been found, usually carved with animals, but a few with human figures. The \"Pashupati\" seal, excavated in Mohenjo-daro, Pakistan, in 1928–29, is the best known.[373][374]  After this there is a long period with virtually nothing surviving.[374][375] Almost all surviving ancient Indian art thereafter is in various forms of religious sculpture in durable materials, or coins. There was probably originally far more in wood, which is lost. In north India Mauryan art is the first imperial movement.[376][377][378] In the first millennium CE, Buddhist art spread with Indian religions to Central, East and South-East Asia, the last also greatly influenced by Hindu art.[379] Over the following centuries a distinctly Indian style of sculpting the human figure developed, with less interest in articulating precise anatomy than ancient Greek sculpture but showing smoothly-flowing forms expressing prana (\"breath\" or life-force).[380][381] This is often complicated by the need to give figures multiple arms or heads, or represent different genders on the left and right of figures, as with the Ardhanarishvara form of Shiva and Parvati.[382][383]\\nMost of the earliest large sculpture is Buddhist, either excavated from Buddhist stupas such as Sanchi, Sarnath and Amaravati,[384] or is rock-cut reliefs at sites such as Ajanta, Karla and Ellora. Hindu and Jain sites appear rather later.[385][386] In spite of this complex mixture of religious traditions, generally, the prevailing artistic style at any time and place has been shared by the major religious groups, and sculptors probably usually served all communities.[387] Gupta art, at its peak c.\\u2009300\\xa0CE\\xa0– c.\\u2009500\\xa0CE, is often regarded as a classical period whose influence lingered for many centuries after; it saw a new dominance of Hindu sculpture, as at the Elephanta Caves.[388][389] Across the north, this became rather stiff and formulaic after c.\\u2009800\\xa0CE, though rich with finely carved detail in the surrounds of statues.[390] But in the South, under the Pallava and Chola dynasties, sculpture in both stone and bronze had a sustained period of great achievement; the large bronzes with Shiva as Nataraja have become an iconic symbol of India.[391][392]\\nAncient painting has only survived at a few sites, of which the crowded scenes of court life in the Ajanta Caves are by far the most important, but it was evidently highly developed, and is mentioned as a courtly accomplishment in Gupta times.[393][394] Painted manuscripts of religious texts survive from Eastern India about the 10th century onwards, most of the earliest being Buddhist and later Jain. No doubt the style of these was used in larger paintings.[395] The Persian-derived Deccan painting, starting just before the Mughal miniature, between them give the first large body of secular painting, with an emphasis on portraits, and the recording of princely pleasures and wars.[396][397] The style spread to Hindu courts, especially among the Rajputs, and developed a variety of styles, with the smaller courts often the most innovative, with figures such as Nihâl Chand and Nainsukh.[398][399] As a market developed among European residents, it was supplied by Company painting by Indian artists with considerable Western influence.[400][401] In the 19th century, cheap Kalighat paintings of gods and everyday life, done on paper, were urban folk art from Calcutta, which later saw the Bengal School of Art, reflecting the art colleges founded by the British, the first movement in modern Indian painting.[402][403]\\nBhutesvara Yakshis, Buddhist reliefs from Mathura, 2nd century\\xa0CE\\nGupta terracotta relief, Krishna Killing the Horse Demon Keshi, 5th century\\nElephanta Caves, triple-bust (trimurti) of Shiva, 18 feet (5.5\\xa0m) tall, c.\\u2009550\\nChola bronze of Shiva as Nataraja (\"Lord of Dance\"), Tamil Nadu, 10th or 11th century.\\nJahangir Receives Prince Khurram at Ajmer on His Return from the Mewar Campaign, Balchand,  c.\\u20091635\\nKrishna Fluting to the Milkmaids, Kangra painting, 1775–1785\\nMuch of Indian architecture, including the Taj Mahal, other works of Indo-Islamic Mughal architecture,  and South Indian architecture, blends ancient local traditions with imported styles.[404] Vernacular architecture is also regional in its flavours. Vastu shastra, literally \"science of construction\" or \"architecture\" and ascribed to Mamuni Mayan,[405] explores how the laws of nature affect human dwellings;[406] it employs precise geometry and directional alignments to reflect perceived cosmic constructs.[407] As applied in Hindu temple architecture, it is influenced by the Shilpa Shastras, a series of foundational texts whose basic mythological form is the Vastu-Purusha mandala, a square that embodied the \"absolute\".[408] The Taj Mahal, built in Agra between 1631 and 1648 by orders of Mughal emperor Shah Jahan in memory of his wife, has been described in the UNESCO World Heritage List as \"the jewel of Muslim art in India and one of the universally admired masterpieces of the world\\'s heritage\".[409] Indo-Saracenic Revival architecture, developed by the British in the late 19th century, drew on Indo-Islamic architecture.[410]\\nThe earliest literature in India, composed between 1500\\xa0BCE and 1200\\xa0CE, was in the Sanskrit language.[411] Major works of Sanskrit literature include the Rigveda (c.\\u20091500\\xa0BCE\\xa0– c.\\u20091200\\xa0BCE), the epics: Mahābhārata ( c.\\u2009400\\xa0BCE\\xa0– c.\\u2009400\\xa0CE) and the Ramayana ( c.\\u2009300\\xa0BCE and later); Abhijñānaśākuntalam (The Recognition of Śakuntalā, and other dramas of Kālidāsa ( c.\\u20095th century\\xa0CE) and Mahākāvya poetry.[412][413][414] In Tamil literature, the Sangam literature (c.\\u2009600\\xa0BCE\\xa0– c.\\u2009300\\xa0BCE) consisting of 2,381 poems, composed by 473 poets, is the earliest work.[415][416][417][418] From the 14th to the 18th centuries, India\\'s literary traditions went through a period of drastic change because of the emergence of devotional poets like Kabīr, Tulsīdās, and Guru Nānak. This period was characterised by a varied and wide spectrum of thought and expression; as a consequence, medieval Indian literary works differed significantly from classical traditions.[419] In the 19th century, Indian writers took a new interest in social questions and psychological descriptions. In the 20th century, Indian literature was influenced by the works of the Bengali poet, author and philosopher Rabindranath Tagore,[420] who was a recipient of the Nobel Prize in Literature.\\nIndian music ranges over various traditions and regional styles. Classical music encompasses two genres and their various folk offshoots: the northern Hindustani and southern Carnatic schools.[421] Regionalised popular forms include filmi and folk music; the syncretic tradition of the bauls is a well-known form of the latter. Indian dance also features diverse folk and classical forms. Among the better-known folk dances are: the bhangra of Punjab, the bihu of Assam, the Jhumair and chhau of Jharkhand, Odisha and West Bengal, garba and dandiya of Gujarat, ghoomar of Rajasthan, and the lavani of Maharashtra. Eight dance forms, many with narrative forms and mythological elements, have been accorded classical dance status by India\\'s National Academy of Music, Dance, and Drama. These are: bharatanatyam of the state of Tamil Nadu, kathak of Uttar Pradesh, kathakali and mohiniyattam of Kerala, kuchipudi of Andhra Pradesh, manipuri of Manipur, odissi of Odisha, and the sattriya of Assam.[422]\\nTheatre in India melds music, dance, and improvised or written dialogue.[423] Often based on Hindu mythology, but also borrowing from medieval romances or social and political events, Indian theatre includes: the bhavai of Gujarat, the jatra of West Bengal, the nautanki and ramlila of North India, tamasha of Maharashtra, burrakatha of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana, terukkuttu of Tamil Nadu, and the yakshagana of Karnataka.[424] India has a theatre training institute the National School of Drama (NSD) that is situated at New Delhi It is an autonomous organisation under the Ministry of culture, Government of India.[425]\\nThe Indian film industry produces the world\\'s most-watched cinema.[426] Established regional cinematic traditions exist in the Assamese, Bengali, Bhojpuri, Hindi, Kannada, Malayalam, Punjabi, Gujarati, Marathi, Odia, Tamil, and Telugu languages.[427] The Hindi language film industry (Bollywood) is the largest sector representing 43% of box office revenue, followed by the South Indian Telugu and Tamil film industries which represent 36% combined.[428]\\nTelevision broadcasting began in India in 1959 as a state-run medium of communication and expanded slowly for more than two decades.[429][430] The state monopoly on television broadcast ended in the 1990s. Since then, satellite channels have increasingly shaped the popular culture of Indian society.[431] Today, television is the most penetrative media in India; industry estimates indicate that as of 2012[update] there are over 554 million TV consumers, 462\\xa0million with satellite or cable connections compared to other forms of mass media such as the press (350\\xa0million), radio (156\\xa0million) or internet (37\\xa0million).[432]\\nTraditional Indian society is sometimes defined by social hierarchy. The Indian caste system embodies much of the social stratification and many of the social restrictions found on the Indian subcontinent. Social classes are defined by thousands of endogamous hereditary groups, often termed as jātis, or \"castes\".[433] India abolished untouchability in 1950 with the adoption of the constitution and has since enacted other anti-discriminatory laws and social welfare initiatives.\\nFamily values are important in the Indian tradition, and multi-generational patrilineal joint families have been the norm in India, though nuclear families are becoming common in urban areas.[434] An overwhelming majority of Indians, with their consent, have their marriages arranged by their parents or other family elders.[435] Marriage is thought to be for life,[435] and the divorce rate is extremely low,[436] with less than one in a thousand marriages ending in divorce.[437] Child marriages are common, especially in rural areas; many women wed before reaching 18, which is their legal marriageable age.[438] Female infanticide in India, and lately female foeticide, have created skewed gender ratios; the number of missing women in the country quadrupled from 15 million to 63 million in the 50-year period ending in 2014, faster than the population growth during the same period, and constituting 20 percent of India\\'s female electorate.[439] Accord to an Indian government study, an additional 21 million girls are unwanted and do not receive adequate care.[440] Despite a government ban on sex-selective foeticide, the practice remains commonplace in India, the result of a preference for boys in a patriarchal society.[441] The payment of dowry, although illegal, remains widespread across class lines.[442] Deaths resulting from dowry, mostly from bride burning, are on the rise, despite stringent anti-dowry laws.[443]\\nMany Indian festivals are religious in origin. The best known include: Diwali, Ganesh Chaturthi, Thai Pongal, Holi, Durga Puja, Eid ul-Fitr, Bakr-Id, Christmas, and Vaisakhi.[444][445]\\nIn the 2011 census, about 73% of the population was literate, with 81% for men and 65% for women. This compares to 1981 when the respective rates were 41%, 53% and 29%. In 1951 the rates were 18%, 27% and 9%. In 1921 the rates 7%, 12% and 2%. In 1891 they were 5%, 9% and 1%,[446][447] According to Latika Chaudhary, in 1911 there were under three primary schools for every ten villages. Statistically, more caste and religious diversity reduced private spending. Primary schools taught literacy, so local diversity limited its growth.[448]\\nThe education system of India is the world\\'s second-largest.[449] India has over 900 universities, 40,000 colleges[450] and 1.5 million schools.[451] In India\\'s higher education system, a significant number of seats are reserved under affirmative action policies for the historically disadvantaged. In recent decades India\\'s improved education system is often cited as one of the main contributors to its economic development.[452][453]\\nFrom ancient times until the advent of the modern, the most widely worn traditional dress in India was draped.[454] For women it took the form of a sari, a single piece of cloth many yards long.[454] The sari was traditionally wrapped around the lower body and the shoulder.[454] In its modern form, it is combined with an underskirt, or Indian petticoat, and tucked in the waist band for more secure fastening. It is also commonly worn with an Indian blouse, or choli, which serves as the primary upper-body garment, the sari\\'s end—passing over the shoulder—serving to cover the midriff and obscure the upper body\\'s contours.[454] For men, a similar but shorter length of cloth, the dhoti, has served as a lower-body garment.[455]\\nThe use of stitched clothes became widespread after Muslim rule was established at first by the Delhi sultanate (ca 1300 CE) and then continued by the Mughal Empire (ca 1525 CE).[456] Among the garments introduced during this time and still commonly worn are: the shalwars and pyjamas, both styles of trousers, and the tunics kurta and kameez.[456] In southern India, the traditional draped garments were to see much longer continuous use.[456]\\nShalwars are atypically wide at the waist but narrow to a cuffed bottom. They are held up by a drawstring, which causes them to become pleated around the waist.[457] The pants can be wide and baggy, or they can be cut quite narrow, on the bias, in which case they are called churidars. When they are ordinarily wide at the waist and their bottoms are hemmed but not cuffed, they are called pyjamas. The kameez is a long shirt or tunic,[458] its side seams left open below the waist-line.[459]  The kurta is traditionally collarless and made of cotton or silk; it is worn plain or with embroidered decoration, such as chikan; and typically falls to either just above or just below the wearer\\'s knees.[460]\\nIn the last 50 years, fashions have changed a great deal in India. Increasingly, in urban northern India, the sari is no longer the apparel of everyday wear, though they remain popular on formal occasions.[461] The traditional shalwar kameez is rarely worn by younger urban women, who favour churidars or jeans.[461]  In white-collar office settings, ubiquitous air conditioning allows men to wear sports jackets year-round.[461] For weddings and formal occasions, men in the middle- and upper classes often wear bandgala, or short Nehru jackets, with pants, with the groom and his groomsmen sporting sherwanis and churidars.[461] The dhoti, once the universal garment of Hindu males, the wearing of which in the homespun and handwoven khadi allowed Gandhi to bring Indian nationalism to the millions,[462]\\nis seldom seen in the cities.[461]\\nThe foundation of a typical Indian meal is a cereal cooked in a plain fashion and complemented with flavourful savoury dishes.[463] The cooked cereal could be steamed rice; chapati, a thin unleavened bread made from wheat flour, or occasionally cornmeal, and griddle-cooked dry;[464] the idli, a steamed breakfast cake, or dosa, a griddled pancake, both leavened and made from a batter of rice- and gram meal.[465]  The savoury dishes might include lentils, pulses and vegetables commonly spiced with ginger and garlic, but also with a combination of spices that may include coriander, cumin, turmeric, cinnamon, cardamon and others as informed by culinary conventions.[463] They might also include poultry, fish, or meat dishes. In some instances, the ingredients might be mixed during the process of cooking.[466]\\nA platter, or thali, used for eating usually has a central place reserved for the cooked cereal, and peripheral ones for the flavourful accompaniments, which are often served in small bowls. The cereal and its accompaniments are eaten simultaneously rather than a piecemeal manner.  This is accomplished by mixing—for example of rice and lentils—or folding, wrapping, scooping or dipping—such as chapati and cooked vegetables or lentils.[463]\\nIndia has distinctive vegetarian cuisines, each a feature of the geographical and cultural histories of its adherents.[468] The appearance of ahimsa, or the avoidance of violence toward all forms of life in many religious orders early in Indian history, especially Upanishadic Hinduism, Buddhism and Jainism, is thought to have contributed to the predominance of vegetarianism among a large segment of India\\'s Hindu population, especially in southern India, Gujarat, the Hindi-speaking belt of north-central India, as well as among Jains.[468]  Although meat is eaten widely in India,  the proportional consumption of meat in the overall diet is low.[469] Unlike China, which has increased its per capita meat consumption substantially in its years of increased economic growth, in India the strong dietary traditions have contributed to dairy, rather than meat, becoming the preferred form of animal protein consumption.[470]\\nThe most significant import of cooking techniques into India during the last millennium occurred during the Mughal Empire. Dishes such as the pilaf,[471] developed in the Abbasid caliphate,[472] and cooking techniques such as the marinating of meat in yogurt, spread into northern India from regions to its northwest.[473]  To the simple yogurt marinade of Persia, onions, garlic, almonds, and spices began to be added in India.[473] Rice was partially cooked and layered alternately with the sauteed meat, the pot sealed tightly, and slow cooked according to another Persian cooking technique, to produce what has today become the Indian biryani,[473] a feature of festive dining in many parts of India.[474] In the food served in Indian restaurants worldwide the diversity of Indian food has been partially concealed by the dominance of Punjabi cuisine. The popularity of tandoori chicken—cooked in the tandoor oven, which had traditionally been used for baking bread in the rural Punjab and the Delhi region, especially among Muslims, but which is originally from Central Asia—dates to the 1950s, and was caused in large part by an entrepreneurial response among people from the Punjab who had been displaced by the 1947 partition of India.[468]\\nSeveral traditional indigenous sports such as kabaddi, kho kho, pehlwani and gilli-danda, and also martial arts, such as Kalarippayattu and marma adi remain popular. Chess is commonly held to have originated in India as chaturaṅga;[476] There has been a rise in the number of Indian grandmasters.[477] Viswanathan Anand became the undisputed Chess World Champion in 2007 and held the status until 2013.[478] Parcheesi is derived from Pachisi another traditional Indian pastime, which in early modern times was played on a giant marble court by Mughal emperor Akbar the Great.[479]\\nCricket is the most popular sport in India.[480] Major domestic competitions include the Indian Premier League, which is the most-watched cricket league in the world and ranks sixth among all sports leagues.[481] Other professional leagues include the Indian Super League (football) and the pro Kabaddi league.[482][483][484]\\nIndia has won two ODI Cricket world cups, the 1983 edition and the 2011 edition and has eight field hockey gold medals in the summer olympics[485]\\nThe improved results garnered by the Indian Davis Cup team and other Indian tennis players in the early 2010s have made tennis increasingly popular in the country.[486] India has a comparatively strong presence in shooting sports, and has won several medals at the Olympics, the World Shooting Championships, and the Commonwealth Games.[487][488] Other sports in which Indians have succeeded internationally include badminton[489] (Saina Nehwal and P. V. Sindhu are two of the top-ranked female badminton players in the world), boxing,[490] and wrestling.[491] Football is popular in West Bengal, Goa, Tamil Nadu, Kerala, and the north-eastern states.[492]\\nIndia has hosted or co-hosted several international sporting events: the 1951 and 1982 Asian Games; the 1987, 1996, and 2011 Cricket World Cup tournaments; the 2003 Afro-Asian Games; the 2006 ICC Champions Trophy; the 2009 World Badminton Championships; the 2010 Hockey World Cup; the 2010 Commonwealth Games; and the 2017 FIFA U-17 World Cup. Major international sporting events held annually in India include the Maharashtra Open, the Mumbai Marathon, the Delhi Half Marathon, and the Indian Masters. The first Formula 1 Indian Grand Prix featured in late 2011 but has been discontinued from the F1 season calendar since 2014.[493] India has traditionally been the dominant country at the South Asian Games. An example of this dominance is the basketball competition where the Indian team won three out of four tournaments to date.[494]\\nOverview\\nEtymology\\nHistory\\nGeography\\nBiodiversity\\nPolitics\\nForeign relations and military\\nEconomy\\nDemographics\\nArt\\nCulture\\nGovernment\\nGeneral information\\nCoordinates: 21°N 78°E\\ufeff / \\ufeff21°N 78°E\\ufeff / 21; 78\\n\\nIndia, officially the Republic of India (Hindi: Bhārat Gaṇarājya),[26] is a country in South Asia. It is the seventh-largest country by area, the second-most populous country, and the most populous democracy in the world. Bounded by the Indian Ocean on the south, the Arabian Sea on the southwest, and the Bay of Bengal on the southeast, it shares land borders with Pakistan to the west;[f] China, Nepal, and Bhutan to the north; and Bangladesh and Myanmar to the east. In the Indian Ocean, India is in the vicinity of Sri Lanka and the Maldives; its Andaman and Nicobar Islands share a maritime border with Thailand, Myanmar and Indonesia.\\nModern humans arrived on the Indian subcontinent from Africa no later than 55,000 years ago.[27][28][29]\\nTheir long occupation, initially in varying forms of isolation as hunter-gatherers, has made the region highly diverse, second only to Africa in human genetic diversity.[30] Settled life emerged on the subcontinent in the western margins of the Indus river basin 9,000 years ago, evolving gradually into the Indus Valley civilisation of the third millennium BCE.[31]\\nBy 1200\\xa0BCE, an archaic form of Sanskrit, an Indo-European language, had diffused into India from the northwest,[32][33] unfolding as the language of the Rigveda, and recording the dawning of Hinduism in India.[34] The Dravidian languages of India were supplanted in the northern and western regions.[35]\\nBy 400\\xa0BCE, stratification and exclusion by caste had emerged within Hinduism,[36]\\nand Buddhism and Jainism had arisen, proclaiming social orders unlinked to heredity.[37]\\nEarly political consolidations gave rise to the loose-knit Maurya and Gupta Empires based in the Ganges Basin.[38]\\nTheir collective era was suffused with wide-ranging creativity,[39] but also marked by the declining status of women,[40] and the incorporation of untouchability into an organised system of belief.[g][41] In South India, the Middle kingdoms exported Dravidian-languages scripts and religious cultures to the kingdoms of Southeast Asia.[42]\\nIn the early medieval era, Christianity, Islam, Judaism, and Zoroastrianism became established on India\\'s southern and western coasts.[43]\\nMuslim armies from Central Asia intermittently overran India\\'s northern plains,[44]\\neventually founding the Delhi Sultanate, and drawing northern India into the cosmopolitan networks of medieval Islam.[45]\\nIn the 15th century, the Vijayanagara Empire created a long-lasting composite Hindu culture in south India.[46]\\nIn the Punjab, Sikhism emerged, rejecting institutionalised religion.[47]\\nThe Mughal Empire, in 1526, ushered in two centuries of relative peace,[48]\\nleaving a legacy of luminous architecture.[h][49]\\nGradually expanding rule of the British East India Company followed, turning India into a colonial economy, but also consolidating its sovereignty.[50] British Crown rule began in 1858. The rights promised to Indians were granted slowly,[51][52] but technological changes were introduced, and ideas of education, modernity and the public life took root.[53] A pioneering and influential nationalist movement emerged, which was noted for nonviolent resistance and became the major factor in ending British rule.[54][55] In 1947 the British Indian Empire was partitioned into two independent dominions,[56][57][58][59] a Hindu-majority Dominion of India and a Muslim-majority Dominion of Pakistan, amid large-scale loss of life and an unprecedented migration.[60]\\nIndia has been a federal republic since 1950, governed in a democratic parliamentary system. It is a pluralistic, multilingual and multi-ethnic society. India\\'s population grew from 361 million in 1951 to 1.211\\xa0billion in 2011.[61]\\nDuring the same time, its nominal per capita income increased from US$64 annually to US$1,498, and its literacy rate from 16.6% to 74%. From being a comparatively destitute country in 1951,[62]\\nIndia has become a fast-growing major economy and a hub for information technology services, with an expanding middle class.[63] It has a space programme which includes several planned or completed extraterrestrial missions. Indian movies, music, and spiritual teachings play an increasing role in global culture.[64]\\nIndia has substantially reduced its rate of poverty, though at the cost of increasing economic inequality.[65]\\nIndia is a nuclear-weapon state, which ranks high in military expenditure. It has disputes over Kashmir with its neighbours, Pakistan and China, unresolved since the mid-20th century.[66]\\nAmong the socio-economic challenges India faces are gender inequality, child malnutrition,[67]\\nand rising levels of air pollution.[68]\\nIndia\\'s land is megadiverse, with four biodiversity hotspots.[69] Its forest cover comprises 21.7% of its area.[70] India\\'s wildlife, which has traditionally been viewed with tolerance in India\\'s culture,[71] is supported among these forests, and elsewhere, in protected habitats.\\nAccording to the Oxford English Dictionary (third edition 2009), the name \"India\" is derived from the Classical Latin India, a reference to South Asia and an uncertain region to its east; and in turn derived successively from: Hellenistic Greek India ( Ἰνδία); ancient Greek Indos ( Ἰνδός); Old Persian Hindush, an eastern province of the Achaemenid empire; and ultimately its cognate, the Sanskrit Sindhu, or \"river,\" specifically the Indus River and, by implication, its well-settled southern basin.[72][73] The ancient Greeks referred to the Indians as Indoi (Ἰνδοί), which translates as \"The people of the Indus\".[74]\\nThe term Bharat (Bhārat; pronounced\\xa0[ˈbʱaːɾət] (listen)), mentioned in both Indian epic poetry and the Constitution of India,[75][76] is used in its variations by many Indian languages. A modern rendering of the historical name Bharatavarsha, which applied originally to North India,[77][78] Bharat gained increased currency from the mid-19th century as a native name for India.[75][79]\\nHindustan ([ɦɪndʊˈstaːn] (listen)) is a Middle Persian name for India, introduced during the Mughal Empire and used widely since. Its meaning has varied, referring to a region encompassing present-day northern India and Pakistan or to India in its near entirety.[75][79][80]\\nBy 55,000 years ago, the first modern humans, or Homo sapiens, had arrived on the Indian subcontinent from Africa, where they had earlier evolved.[27][28][29] The earliest known modern human remains in South Asia date to about 30,000 years ago.[27] After 6500\\xa0BCE, evidence for domestication of food crops and animals, construction of permanent structures, and storage of agricultural surplus appeared in Mehrgarh and other sites in what is now Balochistan, Pakistan.[82] These gradually developed into the Indus Valley civilisation,[83][82] the first urban culture in South Asia,[84] which flourished during 2500–1900\\xa0BCE in what is now Pakistan and western India.[85] Centred around cities such as Mohenjo-daro, Harappa, Dholavira, and Kalibangan, and relying on varied forms of subsistence, the civilisation engaged robustly in crafts production and wide-ranging trade.[84]\\nDuring the period 2000–500\\xa0BCE, many regions of the subcontinent transitioned from the Chalcolithic cultures to the Iron Age ones.[86] The Vedas, the oldest scriptures associated with Hinduism,[87] were composed during this period,[88] and historians have analysed these to posit a Vedic culture in the Punjab region and the upper Gangetic Plain.[86] Most historians also consider this period to have encompassed several waves of Indo-Aryan migration into the subcontinent from the north-west.[87] The caste system, which created a hierarchy of priests, warriors, and free peasants, but which excluded indigenous peoples by labelling their occupations impure, arose during this period.[89] On the Deccan Plateau, archaeological evidence from this period suggests the existence of a chiefdom stage of political organisation.[86] In South India, a progression to sedentary life is indicated by the large number of megalithic monuments dating from this period,[90] as well as by nearby traces of agriculture, irrigation tanks, and craft traditions.[90]\\nIn the late Vedic period, around the 6th century BCE, the small states and chiefdoms of the Ganges Plain and the north-western regions had consolidated into 16 major oligarchies and monarchies that were known as the mahajanapadas.[91][92] The emerging urbanisation gave rise to non-Vedic religious movements, two of which became independent religions. Jainism came into prominence during the life of its exemplar, Mahavira.[93] Buddhism, based on the teachings of Gautama Buddha, attracted followers from all social classes excepting the middle class; chronicling the life of the Buddha was central to the beginnings of recorded history in India.[94][95][96] In an age of increasing urban wealth, both religions held up renunciation as an ideal,[97] and both established long-lasting monastic traditions. Politically, by the 3rd century BCE, the kingdom of Magadha had annexed or reduced other states to emerge as the Mauryan Empire.[98] The empire was once thought to have controlled most of the subcontinent except the far south, but its core regions are now thought to have been separated by large autonomous areas.[99][100] The Mauryan kings are known as much for their empire-building and determined management of public life as for Ashoka\\'s renunciation of militarism and far-flung advocacy of the Buddhist dhamma.[101][102]\\nThe Sangam literature of the Tamil language reveals that, between 200\\xa0BCE and 200\\xa0CE, the southern peninsula was ruled by the Cheras, the Cholas, and the Pandyas, dynasties that traded extensively with the Roman Empire and with West and South-East Asia.[103][104] In North India, Hinduism asserted patriarchal control within the family, leading to increased subordination of women.[105][98] By the 4th and 5th centuries, the Gupta Empire had created a complex system of administration and taxation in the greater Ganges Plain; this system became a model for later Indian kingdoms.[106][107] Under the Guptas, a renewed Hinduism based on devotion, rather than the management of ritual, began to assert itself.[108] This renewal was reflected in a flowering of sculpture and architecture, which found patrons among an urban elite.[107] Classical Sanskrit literature flowered as well, and Indian science, astronomy, medicine, and mathematics made significant advances.[107]\\nThe Indian early medieval age, from 600 to 1200\\xa0CE, is defined by regional kingdoms and cultural diversity.[109] When Harsha of Kannauj, who ruled much of the Indo-Gangetic Plain from 606 to 647\\xa0CE, attempted to expand southwards, he was defeated by the Chalukya ruler of the Deccan.[110] When his successor attempted to expand eastwards, he was defeated by the Pala king of Bengal.[110] When the Chalukyas attempted to expand southwards, they were defeated by the Pallavas from farther south, who in turn were opposed by the Pandyas and the Cholas from still farther south.[110] No ruler of this period was able to create an empire and consistently control lands much beyond their core region.[109] During this time, pastoral peoples, whose land had been cleared to make way for the growing agricultural economy, were accommodated within caste society, as were new non-traditional ruling classes.[111] The caste system consequently began to show regional differences.[111]\\nIn the 6th and 7th centuries, the first devotional hymns were created in the Tamil language.[112] They were imitated all over India and led to both the resurgence of Hinduism and the development of all modern languages of the subcontinent.[112] Indian royalty, big and small, and the temples they patronised drew citizens in great numbers to the capital cities, which became economic hubs as well.[113] Temple towns of various sizes began to appear everywhere as India underwent another urbanisation.[113] By the 8th and 9th centuries, the effects were felt in South-East Asia, as South Indian culture and political systems were exported to lands that became part of modern-day Myanmar, Thailand, Laos, Brunei, Cambodia, Vietnam, Philippines, Malaysia, and Indonesia.[114] Indian merchants, scholars, and sometimes armies were involved in this transmission; South-East Asians took the initiative as well, with many sojourning in Indian seminaries and translating Buddhist and Hindu texts into their languages.[114]\\nAfter the 10th century, Muslim Central Asian nomadic clans, using swift-horse cavalry and raising vast armies united by ethnicity and religion, repeatedly overran South Asia\\'s north-western plains, leading eventually to the establishment of the Islamic Delhi Sultanate in 1206.[115] The sultanate was to control much of North India and to make many forays into South India. Although at first disruptive for the Indian elites, the sultanate largely left its vast non-Muslim subject population to its own laws and customs.[116][117] By repeatedly repulsing Mongol raiders in the 13th century, the sultanate saved India from the devastation visited on West and Central Asia, setting the scene for centuries of migration of fleeing soldiers, learned men, mystics, traders, artists, and artisans from that region into the subcontinent, thereby creating a syncretic Indo-Islamic culture in the north.[118][119] The sultanate\\'s raiding and weakening of the regional kingdoms of South India paved the way for the indigenous Vijayanagara Empire.[120] Embracing a strong Shaivite tradition and building upon the military technology of the sultanate, the empire came to control much of peninsular India,[121] and was to influence South Indian society for long afterwards.[120]\\nIn the early 16th century, northern India, then under mainly Muslim rulers,[122] fell again to the superior mobility and firepower of a new generation of Central Asian warriors.[123] The resulting Mughal Empire did not stamp out the local societies it came to rule. Instead, it balanced and pacified them through new administrative practices[124][125] and diverse and inclusive ruling elites,[126] leading to more systematic, centralised, and uniform rule.[127] Eschewing tribal bonds and Islamic identity, especially under Akbar, the Mughals united their far-flung realms through loyalty, expressed through a Persianised culture, to an emperor who had near-divine status.[126] The Mughal state\\'s economic policies, deriving most revenues from agriculture[128] and mandating that taxes be paid in the well-regulated silver currency,[129] caused peasants and artisans to enter larger markets.[127] The relative peace maintained by the empire during much of the 17th century was a factor in India\\'s economic expansion,[127] resulting in greater patronage of painting, literary forms, textiles, and architecture.[130] Newly coherent social groups in northern and western India, such as the Marathas, the Rajputs, and the Sikhs, gained military and governing ambitions during Mughal rule, which, through collaboration or adversity, gave them both recognition and military experience.[131] Expanding commerce during Mughal rule gave rise to new Indian commercial and political elites along the coasts of southern and eastern India.[131] As the empire disintegrated, many among these elites were able to seek and control their own affairs.[132]\\nBy the early 18th century, with the lines between commercial and political dominance being increasingly blurred, a number of European trading companies, including the English East India Company, had established coastal outposts.[133][134] The East India Company\\'s control of the seas, greater resources, and more advanced military training and technology led it to increasingly assert its military strength and caused it to become attractive to a portion of the Indian elite; these factors were crucial in allowing the company to gain control over the Bengal region by 1765 and sideline the other European companies.[135][133][136][137] Its further access to the riches of Bengal and the subsequent increased strength and size of its army enabled it to annexe or subdue most of India by the 1820s.[138] India was then no longer exporting manufactured goods as it long had, but was instead supplying the British Empire with raw materials. Many historians consider this to be the onset of India\\'s colonial period.[133] By this time, with its economic power severely curtailed by the British parliament and having effectively been made an arm of British administration, the company began more consciously to enter non-economic arenas, including education, social reform and culture.[139]\\nHistorians consider India\\'s modern age to have begun sometime between 1848 and 1885. The appointment in 1848 of Lord Dalhousie as Governor General of the East India Company set the stage for changes essential to a modern state. These included the consolidation and demarcation of sovereignty, the surveillance of the population, and the education of citizens. Technological changes—among them, railways, canals, and the telegraph—were introduced not long after their introduction in Europe.[140][141][142][143] However, disaffection with the company also grew during this time and set off the Indian Rebellion of 1857. Fed by diverse resentments and perceptions, including invasive British-style social reforms, harsh land taxes, and summary treatment of some rich landowners and princes, the rebellion rocked many regions of northern and central India and shook the foundations of Company rule.[144][145] Although the rebellion was suppressed by 1858, it led to the dissolution of the East India Company and the direct administration of India by the British government. Proclaiming a unitary state and a gradual but limited British-style parliamentary system, the new rulers also protected princes and landed gentry as a feudal safeguard against future unrest.[146][147] In the decades following, public life gradually emerged all over India, leading eventually to the founding of the Indian National Congress in 1885.[148][149][150][151]\\nThe rush of technology and the commercialisation of agriculture in the second half of the 19th century was marked by economic setbacks and many small farmers became dependent on the whims of far-away markets.[152] There was an increase in the number of large-scale famines,[153] and, despite the risks of infrastructure development borne by Indian taxpayers, little industrial employment was generated for Indians.[154] There were also salutary effects: commercial cropping, especially in the newly canalled Punjab, led to increased food production for internal consumption.[155] The railway network provided critical famine relief,[156] notably reduced the cost of moving goods,[156] and helped nascent Indian-owned industry.[155]\\nAfter World War I, in which approximately one million Indians served,[157] a new period began. It was marked by British reforms but also repressive legislation, by more strident Indian calls for self-rule, and by the beginnings of a nonviolent movement of non-co-operation, of which Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi would become the leader and enduring symbol.[158] During the 1930s, slow legislative reform was enacted by the British; the Indian National Congress won victories in the resulting elections.[159] The next decade was beset with crises: Indian participation in World War\\xa0II, the Congress\\'s final push for non-co-operation, and an upsurge of Muslim nationalism. All were capped by the advent of independence in 1947, but tempered by the partition of India into two states: India and Pakistan.[160]\\nVital to India\\'s self-image as an independent nation was its constitution, completed in 1950, which put in place a secular and democratic republic.[161] It has remained a democracy with civil liberties, an active supreme court, and a largely independent press.[dubious  – discuss][162] Economic liberalisation, which began in the 1990s, has created a large urban middle class, transformed India into one of the world\\'s fastest-growing economies,[163] and increased its geopolitical clout. Indian movies, music, and spiritual teachings play an increasing role in global culture.[162] Yet, India is also shaped by seemingly unyielding poverty, both rural and urban;[162] by religious and caste-related violence;[164] by Maoist-inspired Naxalite insurgencies;[165] and by separatism in Jammu and Kashmir and in Northeast India.[166] It has unresolved territorial disputes with China[167] and with Pakistan.[167] India\\'s sustained democratic freedoms are unique among the world\\'s newer nations; however, in spite of its recent economic successes, freedom from want for its disadvantaged population remains a goal yet to be achieved.[168]\\nIndia accounts for the bulk of the Indian subcontinent, lying atop the Indian tectonic plate, a part of the Indo-Australian Plate.[169] India\\'s defining geological processes began 75 million years ago when the Indian Plate, then part of the southern supercontinent Gondwana, began a north-eastward drift caused by seafloor spreading to its south-west, and later, south and south-east.[169] Simultaneously, the vast Tethyan oceanic crust, to its northeast, began to subduct under the Eurasian Plate.[169] These dual processes, driven by convection in the Earth\\'s mantle, both created the Indian Ocean and caused the Indian continental crust eventually to under-thrust Eurasia and to uplift the Himalayas.[169] Immediately south of the emerging Himalayas, plate movement created a vast crescent-shaped trough that rapidly filled with river-borne sediment[170] and now constitutes the Indo-Gangetic Plain.[171]   The original Indian plate makes its first appearance above the sediment in the ancient Aravalli range, which extends from the Delhi Ridge in a southwesterly direction. To the west lies the Thar desert, the eastern spread of which is checked by the Aravallis.[172][173][174]\\nThe remaining Indian Plate survives as peninsular India, the oldest and geologically most stable part of India. It extends as far north as the Satpura and Vindhya ranges in central India. These parallel chains run from the Arabian Sea coast in Gujarat in the west to the coal-rich Chota Nagpur Plateau in Jharkhand in the east.[176] To the south, the remaining peninsular landmass, the Deccan Plateau, is flanked on the west and east by coastal ranges known as the Western and Eastern Ghats;[177] the plateau contains the country\\'s oldest rock formations, some over one billion years old. Constituted in such fashion, India lies to the north of the equator between 6° 44′ and 35° 30′ north latitude[i] and 68° 7′ and 97° 25′ east longitude.[178]\\nIndia\\'s coastline measures 7,517 kilometres (4,700\\xa0mi) in length; of this distance, 5,423 kilometres (3,400\\xa0mi) belong to peninsular India and 2,094 kilometres (1,300\\xa0mi) to the Andaman, Nicobar, and Lakshadweep island chains.[179] According to the Indian naval hydrographic charts, the mainland coastline consists of the following: 43% sandy beaches; 11% rocky shores, including cliffs; and 46% mudflats or marshy shores.[179]\\nMajor Himalayan-origin rivers that substantially flow through India include the Ganges and the Brahmaputra, both of which drain into the Bay of Bengal.[180] Important tributaries of the Ganges include the Yamuna and the Kosi; the latter\\'s extremely low gradient, caused by long-term silt deposition, leads to severe floods and course changes.[181][182] Major peninsular rivers, whose steeper gradients prevent their waters from flooding, include the Godavari, the Mahanadi, the Kaveri, and the Krishna, which also drain into the Bay of Bengal;[183] and the Narmada and the Tapti, which drain into the Arabian Sea.[184] Coastal features include the marshy Rann of Kutch of western India and the alluvial Sundarbans delta of eastern India; the latter is shared with Bangladesh.[185] India has two archipelagos: the Lakshadweep, coral atolls off India\\'s south-western coast; and the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, a volcanic chain in the Andaman Sea.[186]\\nIndian climate is strongly influenced by the Himalayas and the Thar Desert, both of which drive the economically and culturally pivotal summer and winter monsoons.[187] The Himalayas prevent cold Central Asian katabatic winds from blowing in, keeping the bulk of the Indian subcontinent warmer than most locations at similar latitudes.[188][189] The Thar Desert plays a crucial role in attracting the moisture-laden south-west summer monsoon winds that, between June and October, provide the majority of India\\'s rainfall.[187] Four major climatic groupings predominate in India: tropical wet, tropical dry, subtropical humid, and montane.[190]\\nTemperatures in India have risen by 0.7\\xa0°C (1.3\\xa0°F) between 1901 and 2018.[191] Climate change in India is often thought to be the cause. The retreat of Himalayan glaciers has adversely affected the flow rate of the major Himalayan rivers, including the Ganges and the Brahmaputra.[192] According to some current projections, the number and severity of droughts in India will have markedly increased by the end of the present century.[193]\\nIndia is a megadiverse country, a term employed for 17 countries which display high biological diversity and contain many species exclusively indigenous, or endemic, to them.[196] India is a habitat for 8.6% of all mammal species, 13.7% of bird species, 7.9% of reptile species, 6% of amphibian species, 12.2% of fish species, and 6.0% of all flowering plant species.[197][198] Fully a third of Indian plant species are endemic.[199] India also contains four of the world\\'s 34 biodiversity hotspots,[69] or regions that display significant habitat loss in the presence of high endemism.[k][200]\\nAccording to official statistics, India\\'s forest cover is 713,789\\xa0km2 (275,595\\xa0sq\\xa0mi), which is 21.71% of the country\\'s total land area.[70] It can be subdivided further into broad categories of canopy density, or the proportion of the area of a forest covered by its tree canopy.[201] Very dense forest, whose canopy density is greater than 70%, occupies 3.02% of India\\'s land area.[201][202] It predominates in the tropical moist forest of the Andaman Islands, the Western Ghats, and Northeast India.[195] Moderately dense forest, whose canopy density is between 40% and 70%, occupies 9.39% of India\\'s land area.[201][202] It predominates in the temperate coniferous forest of the Himalayas, the moist deciduous sal forest of eastern India, and the dry deciduous teak forest of central and southern India.[195] Open forest, whose canopy density is between 10% and 40%, occupies 9.26% of India\\'s land area.[201][202] India has two natural zones of thorn forest, one in the Deccan Plateau, immediately east of the Western Ghats, and the other in the western part of the Indo-Gangetic plain, now turned into rich agricultural land by irrigation, its features no longer visible.[203]\\nAmong the Indian subcontinent\\'s notable indigenous trees are the astringent Azadirachta indica, or neem, which is widely used in rural Indian herbal medicine,[204] and the luxuriant Ficus religiosa, or peepul,[205] which is displayed on the ancient seals of Mohenjo-daro,[206] and under which the Buddha is recorded in the Pali canon to have sought enlightenment.[207]\\nMany Indian species have descended from those of Gondwana, the southern supercontinent from which India separated more than 100 million years ago.[208] India\\'s subsequent collision with Eurasia set off a mass exchange of species. However, volcanism and climatic changes later caused the extinction of many endemic Indian forms.[209] Still later, mammals entered India from Asia through two zoogeographical passes flanking the Himalayas.[195] This had the effect of lowering endemism among India\\'s mammals, which stands at 12.6%, contrasting with 45.8% among reptiles and 55.8% among amphibians.[198]} Among endemics are the vulnerable[210] hooded leaf monkey[211] and the threatened[212] Beddome\\'s toad[212][213] of the Western Ghats.\\nIndia contains 172 IUCN-designated threatened animal species, or 2.9% of endangered forms.[214] These include the endangered Bengal tiger and the Ganges river dolphin. Critically endangered species include: the gharial, a crocodilian; the great Indian bustard; and the Indian white-rumped vulture, which has become nearly extinct by having ingested the carrion of diclofenac-treated cattle.[215] Before they were extensively utilized for agriculture and cleared for human settlement, the thorn forests of Punjab were mingled at intervals with open grasslands that were grazed by large herds of blackbuck preyed on by the Asiatic cheetah; the blackbuck, no longer extant in Punjab, is now severely endangered in India, and the cheetah is extinct.[216] The pervasive and ecologically devastating human encroachment of recent decades has critically endangered Indian wildlife. In response, the system of national parks and protected areas, first established in 1935, was expanded substantially. In 1972, India enacted the Wildlife Protection Act[217] and Project Tiger to safeguard crucial wilderness; the Forest Conservation Act was enacted in 1980 and amendments added in 1988.[218] India hosts more than five hundred wildlife sanctuaries and thirteen\\xa0biosphere reserves,[219] four of which are part of the World Network of Biosphere Reserves; twenty-five wetlands are registered under the Ramsar Convention.[220]\\nIndia is the world\\'s most populous democracy.[222] A parliamentary republic with a multi-party system,[223] it has eight\\xa0recognised national parties, including the Indian National Congress and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), and more than 40\\xa0regional parties.[224] The Congress is considered centre-left in Indian political culture,[225] and the BJP right-wing.[226][227][228] For most of the period between 1950—when India first became a republic—and the late 1980s, the Congress held a majority in the parliament. Since then, however, it has increasingly shared the political stage with the BJP,[229] as well as with powerful regional parties which have often forced the creation of multi-party coalition governments at the centre.[230]\\nIn the Republic of India\\'s first three general elections, in 1951, 1957, and 1962, the Jawaharlal Nehru-led Congress won easy victories. On Nehru\\'s death in 1964, Lal Bahadur Shastri briefly became prime minister; he was succeeded, after his own unexpected death in 1966, by Nehru\\'s daughter Indira Gandhi, who went on to lead the Congress to election victories in 1967 and 1971. Following public discontent with the state of emergency she declared in 1975, the Congress was voted out of power in 1977; the then-new Janata Party, which had opposed the emergency, was voted in. Its government lasted just over two years. Voted back into power in 1980, the Congress saw a change in leadership in 1984, when Indira Gandhi was assassinated; she was succeeded by her son Rajiv Gandhi, who won an easy victory in the general elections later that year. The Congress was voted out again in 1989 when a National Front coalition, led by the newly formed Janata Dal in alliance with the Left Front, won the elections; that government too proved relatively short-lived, lasting just under two years.[231] Elections were held again in 1991; no party won an absolute majority. The Congress, as the largest single party, was able to form a minority government led by P. V. Narasimha Rao.[232]\\nA two-year period of political turmoil followed the general election of 1996. Several short-lived alliances shared power at the centre. The BJP formed a government briefly in 1996; it was followed by two comparatively long-lasting United Front coalitions, which depended on external support. In 1998, the BJP was able to form a successful coalition, the National Democratic Alliance (NDA). Led by Atal Bihari Vajpayee, the NDA became the first non-Congress, coalition government to complete a five-year term.[233] Again in the 2004 Indian general elections, no party won an absolute majority, but the Congress emerged as the largest single party, forming another successful coalition: the United Progressive Alliance (UPA). It had the support of left-leaning parties and MPs who opposed the BJP. The UPA returned to power in the 2009 general election with increased numbers, and it no longer required external support from India\\'s communist parties.[234] That year, Manmohan Singh became the first prime minister since Jawaharlal Nehru in 1957 and 1962 to be re-elected to a consecutive five-year term.[235] In the 2014 general election, the BJP became the first political party since 1984 to win a majority and govern without the support of other parties.[236] The incumbent prime minister is Narendra Modi, a former chief minister of Gujarat. On 20 July 2017, Ram Nath Kovind was elected India\\'s 14th president and took the oath of office on 25 July 2017.[237]\\nIndia is a federation with a parliamentary system governed under the Constitution of India—the country\\'s supreme legal document. It is a constitutional republic and representative democracy, in which \"majority rule is tempered by minority rights protected by law\". Federalism in India defines the power distribution between the union and the states. The Constitution of India, which came into effect on 26 January 1950,[239] originally stated India to be a \"sovereign, democratic republic;\" this characterisation was amended in 1971 to \"a sovereign, socialist, secular, democratic republic\".[240] India\\'s form of government, traditionally described as \"quasi-federal\" with a strong centre and weak states,[241] has grown increasingly federal since the late 1990s as a result of political, economic, and social changes.[242][243]\\nThe Government of India comprises three branches:[244]\\nIndia is a federal union comprising 28 states and 8 union territories.[16] All states, as well as the union territories of Jammu and Kashmir, Puducherry and the National Capital Territory of Delhi, have elected legislatures and governments following the Westminster system of governance. The remaining five union territories are directly ruled by the central government through appointed administrators. In 1956, under the States Reorganisation Act, states were reorganised on a linguistic basis.[260] There are over a quarter of a million local government bodies at city, town, block, district and village levels.[261]\\n\\nIn the 1950s, India strongly supported decolonisation in Africa and Asia and played a leading role in the Non-Aligned Movement.[263] After initially cordial relations with neighbouring China, India went to war with China in 1962, and was widely thought to have been humiliated.[264] India has had tense relations with neighbouring Pakistan; the two nations have gone to war four times: in 1947, 1965, 1971, and 1999. Three of these wars were fought over the disputed territory of Kashmir, while the fourth, the 1971 war, followed from India\\'s support for the independence of Bangladesh.[265] In the late 1980s, the Indian military twice intervened abroad at the invitation of the host country: a peace-keeping operation in Sri Lanka between 1987 and 1990; and an armed intervention to prevent a 1988 coup d\\'état attempt in the Maldives. After the 1965 war with Pakistan, India began to pursue close military and economic ties with the Soviet Union; by the late 1960s, the Soviet Union was its largest arms supplier.[266]\\nAside from ongoing its special relationship with Russia,[267] India has wide-ranging defence relations with Israel and France. In recent years, it has played key roles in the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation and the World Trade Organization. The nation has provided 100,000 military and police personnel to serve in 35 UN peacekeeping operations across four continents. It participates in the East Asia Summit, the G8+5, and other multilateral forums.[268] India has close economic ties with countries in South America,[269] Asia, and Africa; it pursues a \"Look East\" policy that seeks to strengthen partnerships with the ASEAN nations, Japan, and South Korea that revolve around many issues, but especially those involving economic investment and regional security.[270][271]\\nChina\\'s nuclear test of 1964, as well as its repeated threats to intervene in support of Pakistan in the 1965 war, convinced India to develop nuclear weapons.[273] India conducted its first nuclear weapons test in 1974 and carried out additional underground testing in 1998. Despite criticism and military sanctions, India has signed neither the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty nor the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, considering both to be flawed and discriminatory.[274] India maintains a \"no first use\" nuclear policy and is developing a nuclear triad capability as a part of its \"Minimum Credible Deterrence\" doctrine.[275][276] It is developing a ballistic missile defence shield and, a fifth-generation fighter jet.[277][278] Other indigenous military projects involve the design and implementation of Vikrant-class aircraft carriers and Arihant-class nuclear submarines.[279]\\nSince the end of the Cold War, India has increased its economic, strategic, and military co-operation with the United States and the European Union.[280] In 2008, a civilian nuclear agreement was signed between India and the United States. Although India possessed nuclear weapons at the time and was not a party to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, it received waivers from the International Atomic Energy Agency and the Nuclear Suppliers Group, ending earlier restrictions on India\\'s nuclear technology and commerce. As a consequence, India became the sixth de facto nuclear weapons state.[281] India subsequently signed co-operation agreements involving civilian nuclear energy with Russia,[282] France,[283] the United Kingdom,[284] and Canada.[285]\\nThe President of India is the supreme commander of the nation\\'s armed forces; with 1.45\\xa0million active troops, they compose the world\\'s second-largest military. It comprises the Indian Army, the Indian Navy, the Indian Air Force, and the Indian Coast Guard.[286] The official Indian defence budget for 2011 was US$36.03\\xa0billion, or 1.83% of GDP.[287] Defence expenditure was pegged at US$70.12\\xa0billion for fiscal year 2022–23 and, increased 9.8% than previous fiscal year.[288][289] India is the world\\'s second largest arms importer; between 2016 and 2020, it accounted for 9.5% of the total global arms imports.[290] Much of the military expenditure was focused on defence against Pakistan and countering growing Chinese influence in the Indian Ocean.[291] In May 2017, the Indian Space Research Organisation launched the South Asia Satellite, a gift from India to its neighbouring SAARC countries.[292] In October 2018, India signed a US$5.43\\xa0billion (over ₹400\\xa0billion) agreement with Russia to procure four S-400 Triumf surface-to-air missile defence systems, Russia\\'s most advanced long-range missile defence system.[293]\\nAccording to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the Indian economy in 2021 was nominally worth $3.04\\xa0trillion; it is the sixth-largest economy by market exchange rates, and is around $10.219\\xa0trillion, the third-largest by purchasing power parity (PPP).[297] With its average annual GDP growth rate of 5.8% over the past two decades, and reaching 6.1% during 2011–2012,[298] India is one of the world\\'s fastest-growing economies.[299] However, the country ranks 139th in the world in nominal GDP per capita and 118th in GDP per capita at PPP.[300] Until 1991, all Indian governments followed protectionist policies that were influenced by socialist economics. Widespread state intervention and regulation largely walled the economy off from the outside world. An acute balance of payments crisis in 1991 forced the nation to liberalise its economy;[301] since then it has moved slowly towards a free-market system[302][303] by emphasising both foreign trade and direct investment inflows.[304] India has been a member of World Trade Organization since 1 January 1995.[305]\\nThe 522-million-worker Indian labour force is the world\\'s second-largest, as of 2017[update].[286] The service sector makes up 55.6% of GDP, the industrial sector 26.3% and the agricultural sector 18.1%. India\\'s foreign exchange remittances of US$87\\xa0billion in 2021, highest in the world, were contributed to its economy by 32 million Indians working in foreign countries.[306] Major agricultural products include: rice, wheat, oilseed, cotton, jute, tea, sugarcane, and potatoes.[16] Major industries include: textiles, telecommunications, chemicals, pharmaceuticals, biotechnology, food processing, steel, transport equipment, cement, mining, petroleum, machinery, and software.[16] In 2006, the share of external trade in India\\'s GDP stood at 24%, up from 6% in 1985.[302] In 2008, India\\'s share of world trade was 1.68%;[307] In 2011, India was the world\\'s tenth-largest importer and the nineteenth-largest exporter.[308] Major exports include: petroleum products, textile goods, jewellery, software, engineering goods, chemicals, and manufactured leather goods.[16] Major imports include: crude oil, machinery, gems, fertiliser, and chemicals.[16] Between 2001 and 2011, the contribution of petrochemical and engineering goods to total exports grew from 14% to 42%.[309] India was the world\\'s second largest textile exporter after China in the 2013 calendar year.[310]\\nAveraging an economic growth rate of 7.5% for several years prior to 2007,[302] India has more than doubled its hourly wage rates during the first decade of the 21st century.[311] Some 431 million Indians have left poverty since 1985; India\\'s middle classes are projected to number around 580\\xa0million by 2030.[312] Though ranking 51st in global competitiveness, as of 2010[update], India ranks 17th in financial market sophistication, 24th in the banking sector, 44th in business sophistication, and 39th in innovation, ahead of several advanced economies.[313] With seven of the world\\'s top 15 information technology outsourcing companies based in India, as of 2009[update], the country is viewed as the second-most favourable outsourcing destination after the United States.[314] India was ranked 46th in the Global Innovation Index in 2021, it has increased its ranking considerably since 2015, where it was 81st.[315][316][317][318] India\\'s consumer market, the world\\'s eleventh-largest, is expected to become fifth-largest by 2030.[312]\\nDriven by growth, India\\'s nominal GDP per capita increased steadily from US$308 in 1991, when economic liberalisation began, to US$1,380 in 2010, to an estimated US$1,730 in 2016. It is expected to grow to US$2,313 by 2022.[21] However, it has remained lower than those of other Asian developing countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Sri Lanka, and Thailand, and is expected to remain so in the near future.\\nAccording to a 2011 PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) report, India\\'s GDP at purchasing power parity could overtake that of the United States by 2045.[320] During the next four decades, Indian GDP is expected to grow at an annualised average of 8%, making it potentially the world\\'s fastest-growing major economy until 2050.[320] The report highlights key growth factors: a young and rapidly growing working-age population; growth in the manufacturing sector because of rising education and engineering skill levels; and sustained growth of the consumer market driven by a rapidly growing middle-class.[320] The World Bank cautions that, for India to achieve its economic potential, it must continue to focus on public sector reform, transport infrastructure, agricultural and rural development, removal of labour regulations, education, energy security, and public health and nutrition.[321]\\nAccording to the Worldwide Cost of Living Report 2017 released by the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU) which was created by comparing more than 400 individual prices across 160 products and services, four of the cheapest cities were in India: Bangalore (3rd), Mumbai (5th), Chennai (5th) and New Delhi (8th).[322]\\nIndia\\'s telecommunication industry is the second-largest in the world with over 1.2 billion subscribers. It contributes 6.5% to India\\'s GDP.[323] After the third quarter of 2017, India surpassed the US to become the second largest smartphone market in the world after China.[324]\\nThe Indian automotive industry, the world\\'s second-fastest growing, increased domestic sales by 26% during 2009–2010,[325] and exports by 36% during 2008–2009.[326] At the end of 2011, the Indian IT industry employed 2.8\\xa0million professionals, generated revenues close to US$100\\xa0billion equalling 7.5% of Indian GDP, and contributed 26% of India\\'s merchandise exports.[327]\\nThe pharmaceutical industry in India emerged as a global player. As of 2021, with 3000 pharmaceutical companies and 10,500 manufacturing units India is the world\\'s third-largest pharmaceutical producer, largest producer of generic medicines and supply up to 50%—60% of global vaccines demand, these all contribute up to US$24.44\\xa0billions in exports and India\\'s local pharmacutical market is estimated up to US$42\\xa0billion.[328][329] India is among the top 12 biotech destinations in the world.[330][331] The Indian biotech industry grew by 15.1% in 2012–2013, increasing its revenues from ₹204.4\\xa0billion (Indian rupees) to ₹235.24\\xa0billion (US$3.94 billion at June 2013 exchange rates).[332]\\nIndia\\'s capacity to generate electrical power is 300 gigawatts, of which 42 gigawatts is renewable.[333] The country\\'s usage of coal is a major cause of greenhouse gas emissions by India but its renewable energy is competing strongly.[334] India emits about 7% of global greenhouse gas emissions. This equates to about 2.5 tons of carbon dioxide per person per year, which is half the world average.[335][336] Increasing access to electricity and clean cooking with liquefied petroleum gas have been priorities for energy in India.[337]\\nDespite economic growth during recent decades, India continues to face socio-economic challenges. In 2006, India contained the largest number of people living below the World Bank\\'s international poverty line of US$1.25 per day.[339] The proportion decreased from 60% in 1981 to 42% in 2005.[340] Under the World Bank\\'s later revised poverty line, it was 21% in 2011.[l][342] 30.7% of India\\'s children under the age of five are underweight.[343] According to a Food and Agriculture Organization report in 2015, 15% of the population is undernourished.[344][345] The Mid-Day Meal Scheme attempts to lower these rates.[346]\\nA 2018 Walk Free Foundation report estimated that nearly 8\\xa0million people in India were living in different forms of modern slavery, such as bonded labour, child labour, human trafficking, and forced begging, among others.[347] According to the 2011 census, there were 10.1\\xa0million child labourers in the country, a decline of 2.6\\xa0million from 12.6\\xa0million in 2001.[348]\\nSince 1991, economic inequality between India\\'s states has consistently grown: the per-capita net state domestic product of the richest states in 2007 was 3.2 times that of the poorest.[349] Corruption in India is perceived to have decreased. According to the Corruption Perceptions Index, India ranked 78th out of 180 countries in 2018 with a score of 41 out of 100, an improvement from 85th in 2014.[350][351]\\nWith 1,210,193,422 residents reported in the 2011 provisional census report,[352] India is the world\\'s second-most populous country. Its population grew by 17.64% from 2001 to 2011,[353] compared to 21.54% growth in the previous decade (1991–2001).[353] The human sex ratio, according to the 2011 census, is 940 females per 1,000 males.[352] The median age was 28.7 as of 2020[update].[286] The first post-colonial census, conducted in 1951, counted 361\\xa0million people.[354] Medical advances made in the last 50 years as well as increased agricultural productivity brought about by the \"Green Revolution\" have caused India\\'s population to grow rapidly.[355]\\nThe average life expectancy in India is at 70 years—71.5 years for women, 68.7 years for men.[286] There are around 93 physicians per 100,000 people.[356] Migration from rural to urban areas has been an important dynamic in India\\'s recent history. The number of people living in urban areas grew by 31.2% between 1991 and 2001.[357] Yet, in 2001, over 70% still lived in rural areas.[358][359] The level of urbanisation increased further from 27.81% in the 2001 Census to 31.16% in the 2011 Census. The slowing down of the overall population growth rate was due to the sharp decline in the growth rate in rural areas since 1991.[360] According to the 2011 census, there are 53 million-plus urban agglomerations in India; among them Mumbai, Delhi, Kolkata, Chennai, Bangalore, Hyderabad and Ahmedabad, in decreasing order by population.[361] The literacy rate in 2011 was 74.04%: 65.46% among females and 82.14% among males.[362] The rural-urban literacy gap, which was 21.2 percentage points in 2001, dropped to 16.1 percentage points in 2011. The improvement in the rural literacy rate is twice that of urban areas.[360] Kerala is the most literate state with 93.91% literacy; while Bihar the least with 63.82%.[362]\\nIndia is home to two major language families: Indo-Aryan (spoken by about 74% of the population) and Dravidian (spoken by 24% of the population). Other languages spoken in India come from the Austroasiatic and Sino-Tibetan language families. India has no national language.[363] Hindi, with the largest number of speakers, is the official language of the government.[364][365] English is used extensively in business and administration and has the status of a \"subsidiary official language\";[6] it is important in education, especially as a medium of higher education. Each state and union territory has one or more official languages, and the constitution recognises in particular 22 \"scheduled languages\".\\nThe 2011 census reported the religion in India with the largest number of followers was Hinduism (79.80% of the population), followed by Islam (14.23%); the remaining were Christianity (2.30%), Sikhism (1.72%), Buddhism (0.70%), Jainism (0.36%) and others[m] (0.9%).[15] India has the third-largest Muslim population—the largest for a non-Muslim majority country.[366][367]\\nIndian cultural history spans more than 4,500 years.[368] During the Vedic period (c.\\u20091700\\xa0BCE\\xa0– c.\\u2009500\\xa0BCE), the foundations of Hindu philosophy, mythology, theology and literature were laid, and many beliefs and practices which still exist today, such as dhárma, kárma, yóga, and mokṣa, were established.[74] India is notable for its religious diversity, with Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, Islam, Christianity, and Jainism among the nation\\'s major religions.[369] The predominant religion, Hinduism, has been shaped by various historical schools of thought, including those of the Upanishads,[370] the Yoga Sutras, the Bhakti movement,[369] and by Buddhist philosophy.[371]\\nIndia has a very ancient tradition of art, which has exchanged many influences with the rest of Eurasia, especially in the first millennium, when Buddhist art spread with Indian religions to Central, East and South-East Asia, the last also greatly influenced by Hindu art.[372]  Thousands of seals from the Indus Valley Civilization of the third millennium BCE have been found, usually carved with animals, but a few with human figures. The \"Pashupati\" seal, excavated in Mohenjo-daro, Pakistan, in 1928–29, is the best known.[373][374]  After this there is a long period with virtually nothing surviving.[374][375] Almost all surviving ancient Indian art thereafter is in various forms of religious sculpture in durable materials, or coins. There was probably originally far more in wood, which is lost. In north India Mauryan art is the first imperial movement.[376][377][378] In the first millennium CE, Buddhist art spread with Indian religions to Central, East and South-East Asia, the last also greatly influenced by Hindu art.[379] Over the following centuries a distinctly Indian style of sculpting the human figure developed, with less interest in articulating precise anatomy than ancient Greek sculpture but showing smoothly-flowing forms expressing prana (\"breath\" or life-force).[380][381] This is often complicated by the need to give figures multiple arms or heads, or represent different genders on the left and right of figures, as with the Ardhanarishvara form of Shiva and Parvati.[382][383]\\nMost of the earliest large sculpture is Buddhist, either excavated from Buddhist stupas such as Sanchi, Sarnath and Amaravati,[384] or is rock-cut reliefs at sites such as Ajanta, Karla and Ellora. Hindu and Jain sites appear rather later.[385][386] In spite of this complex mixture of religious traditions, generally, the prevailing artistic style at any time and place has been shared by the major religious groups, and sculptors probably usually served all communities.[387] Gupta art, at its peak c.\\u2009300\\xa0CE\\xa0– c.\\u2009500\\xa0CE, is often regarded as a classical period whose influence lingered for many centuries after; it saw a new dominance of Hindu sculpture, as at the Elephanta Caves.[388][389] Across the north, this became rather stiff and formulaic after c.\\u2009800\\xa0CE, though rich with finely carved detail in the surrounds of statues.[390] But in the South, under the Pallava and Chola dynasties, sculpture in both stone and bronze had a sustained period of great achievement; the large bronzes with Shiva as Nataraja have become an iconic symbol of India.[391][392]\\nAncient painting has only survived at a few sites, of which the crowded scenes of court life in the Ajanta Caves are by far the most important, but it was evidently highly developed, and is mentioned as a courtly accomplishment in Gupta times.[393][394] Painted manuscripts of religious texts survive from Eastern India about the 10th century onwards, most of the earliest being Buddhist and later Jain. No doubt the style of these was used in larger paintings.[395] The Persian-derived Deccan painting, starting just before the Mughal miniature, between them give the first large body of secular painting, with an emphasis on portraits, and the recording of princely pleasures and wars.[396][397] The style spread to Hindu courts, especially among the Rajputs, and developed a variety of styles, with the smaller courts often the most innovative, with figures such as Nihâl Chand and Nainsukh.[398][399] As a market developed among European residents, it was supplied by Company painting by Indian artists with considerable Western influence.[400][401] In the 19th century, cheap Kalighat paintings of gods and everyday life, done on paper, were urban folk art from Calcutta, which later saw the Bengal School of Art, reflecting the art colleges founded by the British, the first movement in modern Indian painting.[402][403]\\nBhutesvara Yakshis, Buddhist reliefs from Mathura, 2nd century\\xa0CE\\nGupta terracotta relief, Krishna Killing the Horse Demon Keshi, 5th century\\nElephanta Caves, triple-bust (trimurti) of Shiva, 18 feet (5.5\\xa0m) tall, c.\\u2009550\\nChola bronze of Shiva as Nataraja (\"Lord of Dance\"), Tamil Nadu, 10th or 11th century.\\nJahangir Receives Prince Khurram at Ajmer on His Return from the Mewar Campaign, Balchand,  c.\\u20091635\\nKrishna Fluting to the Milkmaids, Kangra painting, 1775–1785\\nMuch of Indian architecture, including the Taj Mahal, other works of Indo-Islamic Mughal architecture,  and South Indian architecture, blends ancient local traditions with imported styles.[404] Vernacular architecture is also regional in its flavours. Vastu shastra, literally \"science of construction\" or \"architecture\" and ascribed to Mamuni Mayan,[405] explores how the laws of nature affect human dwellings;[406] it employs precise geometry and directional alignments to reflect perceived cosmic constructs.[407] As applied in Hindu temple architecture, it is influenced by the Shilpa Shastras, a series of foundational texts whose basic mythological form is the Vastu-Purusha mandala, a square that embodied the \"absolute\".[408] The Taj Mahal, built in Agra between 1631 and 1648 by orders of Mughal emperor Shah Jahan in memory of his wife, has been described in the UNESCO World Heritage List as \"the jewel of Muslim art in India and one of the universally admired masterpieces of the world\\'s heritage\".[409] Indo-Saracenic Revival architecture, developed by the British in the late 19th century, drew on Indo-Islamic architecture.[410]\\nThe earliest literature in India, composed between 1500\\xa0BCE and 1200\\xa0CE, was in the Sanskrit language.[411] Major works of Sanskrit literature include the Rigveda (c.\\u20091500\\xa0BCE\\xa0– c.\\u20091200\\xa0BCE), the epics: Mahābhārata ( c.\\u2009400\\xa0BCE\\xa0– c.\\u2009400\\xa0CE) and the Ramayana ( c.\\u2009300\\xa0BCE and later); Abhijñānaśākuntalam (The Recognition of Śakuntalā, and other dramas of Kālidāsa ( c.\\u20095th century\\xa0CE) and Mahākāvya poetry.[412][413][414] In Tamil literature, the Sangam literature (c.\\u2009600\\xa0BCE\\xa0– c.\\u2009300\\xa0BCE) consisting of 2,381 poems, composed by 473 poets, is the earliest work.[415][416][417][418] From the 14th to the 18th centuries, India\\'s literary traditions went through a period of drastic change because of the emergence of devotional poets like Kabīr, Tulsīdās, and Guru Nānak. This period was characterised by a varied and wide spectrum of thought and expression; as a consequence, medieval Indian literary works differed significantly from classical traditions.[419] In the 19th century, Indian writers took a new interest in social questions and psychological descriptions. In the 20th century, Indian literature was influenced by the works of the Bengali poet, author and philosopher Rabindranath Tagore,[420] who was a recipient of the Nobel Prize in Literature.\\nIndian music ranges over various traditions and regional styles. Classical music encompasses two genres and their various folk offshoots: the northern Hindustani and southern Carnatic schools.[421] Regionalised popular forms include filmi and folk music; the syncretic tradition of the bauls is a well-known form of the latter. Indian dance also features diverse folk and classical forms. Among the better-known folk dances are: the bhangra of Punjab, the bihu of Assam, the Jhumair and chhau of Jharkhand, Odisha and West Bengal, garba and dandiya of Gujarat, ghoomar of Rajasthan, and the lavani of Maharashtra. Eight dance forms, many with narrative forms and mythological elements, have been accorded classical dance status by India\\'s National Academy of Music, Dance, and Drama. These are: bharatanatyam of the state of Tamil Nadu, kathak of Uttar Pradesh, kathakali and mohiniyattam of Kerala, kuchipudi of Andhra Pradesh, manipuri of Manipur, odissi of Odisha, and the sattriya of Assam.[422]\\nTheatre in India melds music, dance, and improvised or written dialogue.[423] Often based on Hindu mythology, but also borrowing from medieval romances or social and political events, Indian theatre includes: the bhavai of Gujarat, the jatra of West Bengal, the nautanki and ramlila of North India, tamasha of Maharashtra, burrakatha of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana, terukkuttu of Tamil Nadu, and the yakshagana of Karnataka.[424] India has a theatre training institute the National School of Drama (NSD) that is situated at New Delhi It is an autonomous organisation under the Ministry of culture, Government of India.[425]\\nThe Indian film industry produces the world\\'s most-watched cinema.[426] Established regional cinematic traditions exist in the Assamese, Bengali, Bhojpuri, Hindi, Kannada, Malayalam, Punjabi, Gujarati, Marathi, Odia, Tamil, and Telugu languages.[427] The Hindi language film industry (Bollywood) is the largest sector representing 43% of box office revenue, followed by the South Indian Telugu and Tamil film industries which represent 36% combined.[428]\\nTelevision broadcasting began in India in 1959 as a state-run medium of communication and expanded slowly for more than two decades.[429][430] The state monopoly on television broadcast ended in the 1990s. Since then, satellite channels have increasingly shaped the popular culture of Indian society.[431] Today, television is the most penetrative media in India; industry estimates indicate that as of 2012[update] there are over 554 million TV consumers, 462\\xa0million with satellite or cable connections compared to other forms of mass media such as the press (350\\xa0million), radio (156\\xa0million) or internet (37\\xa0million).[432]\\nTraditional Indian society is sometimes defined by social hierarchy. The Indian caste system embodies much of the social stratification and many of the social restrictions found on the Indian subcontinent. Social classes are defined by thousands of endogamous hereditary groups, often termed as jātis, or \"castes\".[433] India abolished untouchability in 1950 with the adoption of the constitution and has since enacted other anti-discriminatory laws and social welfare initiatives.\\nFamily values are important in the Indian tradition, and multi-generational patrilineal joint families have been the norm in India, though nuclear families are becoming common in urban areas.[434] An overwhelming majority of Indians, with their consent, have their marriages arranged by their parents or other family elders.[435] Marriage is thought to be for life,[435] and the divorce rate is extremely low,[436] with less than one in a thousand marriages ending in divorce.[437] Child marriages are common, especially in rural areas; many women wed before reaching 18, which is their legal marriageable age.[438] Female infanticide in India, and lately female foeticide, have created skewed gender ratios; the number of missing women in the country quadrupled from 15 million to 63 million in the 50-year period ending in 2014, faster than the population growth during the same period, and constituting 20 percent of India\\'s female electorate.[439] Accord to an Indian government study, an additional 21 million girls are unwanted and do not receive adequate care.[440] Despite a government ban on sex-selective foeticide, the practice remains commonplace in India, the result of a preference for boys in a patriarchal society.[441] The payment of dowry, although illegal, remains widespread across class lines.[442] Deaths resulting from dowry, mostly from bride burning, are on the rise, despite stringent anti-dowry laws.[443]\\nMany Indian festivals are religious in origin. The best known include: Diwali, Ganesh Chaturthi, Thai Pongal, Holi, Durga Puja, Eid ul-Fitr, Bakr-Id, Christmas, and Vaisakhi.[444][445]\\nIn the 2011 census, about 73% of the population was literate, with 81% for men and 65% for women. This compares to 1981 when the respective rates were 41%, 53% and 29%. In 1951 the rates were 18%, 27% and 9%. In 1921 the rates 7%, 12% and 2%. In 1891 they were 5%, 9% and 1%,[446][447] According to Latika Chaudhary, in 1911 there were under three primary schools for every ten villages. Statistically, more caste and religious diversity reduced private spending. Primary schools taught literacy, so local diversity limited its growth.[448]\\nThe education system of India is the world\\'s second-largest.[449] India has over 900 universities, 40,000 colleges[450] and 1.5 million schools.[451] In India\\'s higher education system, a significant number of seats are reserved under affirmative action policies for the historically disadvantaged. In recent decades India\\'s improved education system is often cited as one of the main contributors to its economic development.[452][453]\\nFrom ancient times until the advent of the modern, the most widely worn traditional dress in India was draped.[454] For women it took the form of a sari, a single piece of cloth many yards long.[454] The sari was traditionally wrapped around the lower body and the shoulder.[454] In its modern form, it is combined with an underskirt, or Indian petticoat, and tucked in the waist band for more secure fastening. It is also commonly worn with an Indian blouse, or choli, which serves as the primary upper-body garment, the sari\\'s end—passing over the shoulder—serving to cover the midriff and obscure the upper body\\'s contours.[454] For men, a similar but shorter length of cloth, the dhoti, has served as a lower-body garment.[455]\\nThe use of stitched clothes became widespread after Muslim rule was established at first by the Delhi sultanate (ca 1300 CE) and then continued by the Mughal Empire (ca 1525 CE).[456] Among the garments introduced during this time and still commonly worn are: the shalwars and pyjamas, both styles of trousers, and the tunics kurta and kameez.[456] In southern India, the traditional draped garments were to see much longer continuous use.[456]\\nShalwars are atypically wide at the waist but narrow to a cuffed bottom. They are held up by a drawstring, which causes them to become pleated around the waist.[457] The pants can be wide and baggy, or they can be cut quite narrow, on the bias, in which case they are called churidars. When they are ordinarily wide at the waist and their bottoms are hemmed but not cuffed, they are called pyjamas. The kameez is a long shirt or tunic,[458] its side seams left open below the waist-line.[459]  The kurta is traditionally collarless and made of cotton or silk; it is worn plain or with embroidered decoration, such as chikan; and typically falls to either just above or just below the wearer\\'s knees.[460]\\nIn the last 50 years, fashions have changed a great deal in India. Increasingly, in urban northern India, the sari is no longer the apparel of everyday wear, though they remain popular on formal occasions.[461] The traditional shalwar kameez is rarely worn by younger urban women, who favour churidars or jeans.[461]  In white-collar office settings, ubiquitous air conditioning allows men to wear sports jackets year-round.[461] For weddings and formal occasions, men in the middle- and upper classes often wear bandgala, or short Nehru jackets, with pants, with the groom and his groomsmen sporting sherwanis and churidars.[461] The dhoti, once the universal garment of Hindu males, the wearing of which in the homespun and handwoven khadi allowed Gandhi to bring Indian nationalism to the millions,[462]\\nis seldom seen in the cities.[461]\\nThe foundation of a typical Indian meal is a cereal cooked in a plain fashion and complemented with flavourful savoury dishes.[463] The cooked cereal could be steamed rice; chapati, a thin unleavened bread made from wheat flour, or occasionally cornmeal, and griddle-cooked dry;[464] the idli, a steamed breakfast cake, or dosa, a griddled pancake, both leavened and made from a batter of rice- and gram meal.[465]  The savoury dishes might include lentils, pulses and vegetables commonly spiced with ginger and garlic, but also with a combination of spices that may include coriander, cumin, turmeric, cinnamon, cardamon and others as informed by culinary conventions.[463] They might also include poultry, fish, or meat dishes. In some instances, the ingredients might be mixed during the process of cooking.[466]\\nA platter, or thali, used for eating usually has a central place reserved for the cooked cereal, and peripheral ones for the flavourful accompaniments, which are often served in small bowls. The cereal and its accompaniments are eaten simultaneously rather than a piecemeal manner.  This is accomplished by mixing—for example of rice and lentils—or folding, wrapping, scooping or dipping—such as chapati and cooked vegetables or lentils.[463]\\nIndia has distinctive vegetarian cuisines, each a feature of the geographical and cultural histories of its adherents.[468] The appearance of ahimsa, or the avoidance of violence toward all forms of life in many religious orders early in Indian history, especially Upanishadic Hinduism, Buddhism and Jainism, is thought to have contributed to the predominance of vegetarianism among a large segment of India\\'s Hindu population, especially in southern India, Gujarat, the Hindi-speaking belt of north-central India, as well as among Jains.[468]  Although meat is eaten widely in India,  the proportional consumption of meat in the overall diet is low.[469] Unlike China, which has increased its per capita meat consumption substantially in its years of increased economic growth, in India the strong dietary traditions have contributed to dairy, rather than meat, becoming the preferred form of animal protein consumption.[470]\\nThe most significant import of cooking techniques into India during the last millennium occurred during the Mughal Empire. Dishes such as the pilaf,[471] developed in the Abbasid caliphate,[472] and cooking techniques such as the marinating of meat in yogurt, spread into northern India from regions to its northwest.[473]  To the simple yogurt marinade of Persia, onions, garlic, almonds, and spices began to be added in India.[473] Rice was partially cooked and layered alternately with the sauteed meat, the pot sealed tightly, and slow cooked according to another Persian cooking technique, to produce what has today become the Indian biryani,[473] a feature of festive dining in many parts of India.[474] In the food served in Indian restaurants worldwide the diversity of Indian food has been partially concealed by the dominance of Punjabi cuisine. The popularity of tandoori chicken—cooked in the tandoor oven, which had traditionally been used for baking bread in the rural Punjab and the Delhi region, especially among Muslims, but which is originally from Central Asia—dates to the 1950s, and was caused in large part by an entrepreneurial response among people from the Punjab who had been displaced by the 1947 partition of India.[468]\\nSeveral traditional indigenous sports such as kabaddi, kho kho, pehlwani and gilli-danda, and also martial arts, such as Kalarippayattu and marma adi remain popular. Chess is commonly held to have originated in India as chaturaṅga;[476] There has been a rise in the number of Indian grandmasters.[477] Viswanathan Anand became the undisputed Chess World Champion in 2007 and held the status until 2013.[478] Parcheesi is derived from Pachisi another traditional Indian pastime, which in early modern times was played on a giant marble court by Mughal emperor Akbar the Great.[479]\\nCricket is the most popular sport in India.[480] Major domestic competitions include the Indian Premier League, which is the most-watched cricket league in the world and ranks sixth among all sports leagues.[481] Other professional leagues include the Indian Super League (football) and the pro Kabaddi league.[482][483][484]\\nIndia has won two ODI Cricket world cups, the 1983 edition and the 2011 edition and has eight field hockey gold medals in the summer olympics[485]\\nThe improved results garnered by the Indian Davis Cup team and other Indian tennis players in the early 2010s have made tennis increasingly popular in the country.[486] India has a comparatively strong presence in shooting sports, and has won several medals at the Olympics, the World Shooting Championships, and the Commonwealth Games.[487][488] Other sports in which Indians have succeeded internationally include badminton[489] (Saina Nehwal and P. V. Sindhu are two of the top-ranked female badminton players in the world), boxing,[490] and wrestling.[491] Football is popular in West Bengal, Goa, Tamil Nadu, Kerala, and the north-eastern states.[492]\\nIndia has hosted or co-hosted several international sporting events: the 1951 and 1982 Asian Games; the 1987, 1996, and 2011 Cricket World Cup tournaments; the 2003 Afro-Asian Games; the 2006 ICC Champions Trophy; the 2009 World Badminton Championships; the 2010 Hockey World Cup; the 2010 Commonwealth Games; and the 2017 FIFA U-17 World Cup. Major international sporting events held annually in India include the Maharashtra Open, the Mumbai Marathon, the Delhi Half Marathon, and the Indian Masters. The first Formula 1 Indian Grand Prix featured in late 2011 but has been discontinued from the F1 season calendar since 2014.[493] India has traditionally been the dominant country at the South Asian Games. An example of this dominance is the basketball competition where the Indian team won three out of four tournaments to date.[494]\\nOverview\\nEtymology\\nHistory\\nGeography\\nBiodiversity\\nPolitics\\nForeign relations and military\\nEconomy\\nDemographics\\nArt\\nCulture\\nGovernment\\nGeneral information\\nCoordinates: 21°N 78°E\\ufeff / \\ufeff21°N 78°E\\ufeff / 21; 78\\nThe Indian government led by the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) escalated its crackdown on civil society and the media. Authorities prosecute activists, journalists, peaceful protesters, and other critics on fabricated counterterrorism and sedition charged. They have shut down rights groups using foreign funding regulations or unfounded allegations of financial irregularities. The government has adopted laws and policies that discriminate against religious minorities, especially Muslims. This, coupled with vilification of Muslims and other minorities by some BJP leaders, and the police failure to act against government supporters who commit violence, has emboldened Hindu nationalist groups to target members of minority communities or civil society groups with impunity.Available in हिन्दी >July 21, 2022July 18, 2022July 5, 2022Year After Delhi Violence, Bias Against Muslims Taints Investigation Poor Enforcement of India’s Sexual Harassment LawDiscrimination Against Muslims under India’s New Citizenship PolicyHow Apparel Brand Purchasing Practices Drive Labor AbusesMeta’s refusal to release its India assessment in full contributes to the perception that its human rights impact assessments are designed to deflect criticism and divert efforts to hold platforms accountableThe colonial-era statute is clear violation of right to free expression.Arbitrary Arrests, Bogus Charges Further Tarnish Government’s ReputationStop Harassing Activists for Defending Human RightsCountries Move to Protect Domestic Food Security as Global Prices SoarUS, Japan, India, Australia Should Address Crises Across Region Authorities Should Stop Targeting, Prosecuting Journalists and Online CriticsNovember 2022Protect Refugees; End Forced Returns IndiaJul 22, 2022\\n\\tTorture &amp; disappearances in Ukraine under Russian occupation;\\n\\tClean break needed in Philippines, after Duterte human rights disaster;\\n\\tAssault on Sri Lanka anti-government protesters camp;\\n\\tTwitter discussion on China\\'s threat to rights and freedoms;\\n\\tProtect people from extreme heat;\\n\\tHistoric human rights win in Canada;\\nHuman Right Watch defends the rights of people in 90 countries worldwide, spotlighting abuses and bringing perpetrators to justice.Get updates on human rights issues from around the globe.
